At Zappos, we don’t measure call times (our longest phone call was almost six hours long!), and we don’t upsell. We just care about whether the rep goes above and beyond for every customer. We don’t have scripts because we trust our employees to use their best judgment when dealing with each and every customer. We want our reps to let their true personalities shine during each phone call so that they can develop a personal emotional connection (internally referred to as PEC) with the customer.

Another example of us using the telephone as a branding device is what happens when a customer calls looking for a specific style of shoes in a specific size that we’re out of stock on. In those instances, every rep is trained to research at least three competitors’ Web sites, and if the shoe is found in stock to direct the customer to the competitor. Obviously, in those situations, we lose the sale. But we’re not trying to maximize each and every transaction. Instead, we’re trying to build a lifelong relationship with each customer, one phone call at a time.

A lot of people may think it’s strange that an Internet company is so focused on the telephone, when only about 5 percent of our sales happen through the telephone. In fact, most of our phone calls don’t even result in sales. But what we’ve found is that on average, every customer contacts us at least once sometime during his or her lifetime, and we just need to make sure that we use that opportunity to create a lasting memory.

The majority of phone calls don’t result in an immediate order. Sometimes a customer may be calling because it’s her first time returning an item, and she just wants a little help stepping through the process. Other times, a customer may call because there’s a wedding coming up this weekend and he wants a little fashion advice. And sometimes, we get customers who call simply because they’re a little lonely and want someone to talk to.

I’m reminded of a time when I was in Santa Monica, California, a few years ago at a Skechers sales conference. After a long night of bar-hopping, a small group of us headed up to someone’s hotel room to order some food. My friend from Skechers tried to order a pepperoni pizza from the room-service menu, but was disappointed to learn that the hotel we were staying at did not deliver hot food after 11:00 PM. We had missed the deadline by several hours.

In our inebriated state, a few of us cajoled her into calling Zappos to try to order a pizza. She took us up on our dare, turned on the speakerphone, and explained to the (very) patient Zappos rep that she was staying in a Santa Monica hotel and really craving a pepperoni pizza, that room service was no longer delivering hot food, and that she wanted to know if there was anything Zappos could do to help.

The Zappos rep was initially a bit confused by the request, but she quickly recovered and put us on hold. She returned two minutes later, listing the five closest places in the Santa Monica area that were still open and delivering pizzas at that time.

Now, truth be told, I was a little hesitant to include this story because I don’t actually want everyone who reads this book to start calling Zappos and ordering pizza. But I just think it’s a fun story to illustrate the power of not having scripts in your call center and empowering your employees to do what’s right for your brand, no matter how unusual or bizarre the situation.

As for my friend from Skechers? After that phone call, she’s now a customer for life.


Top 10 Ways to Instill Customer Service into Your Company


Make customer service a priority for the whole company, not just a department. A customer service attitude needs to come from the top.

Make WOW a verb that is part of your company’s everyday vocabulary.

Empower and trust your customer service reps. Trust that they want to provide great service… because they actually do. Escalations to a supervisor should be rare.

Realize that it’s okay to fire customers who are insatiable or abuse your employees.

Don’t measure call times, don’t force employees to upsell, and don’t use scripts.

Don’t hide your 1-800 number. It’s a message not just to your customers, but to your employees as well.

View each call as an investment in building a customer service brand, not as an expense you’re seeking to minimize.

Have the entire company celebrate great service. Tell stories of WOW experiences to everyone in the company.

Find and hire people who are already passionate about customer service.

Give great service to everyone: customers, employees, and vendors.


Culture


Today, we offer tours of our headquarters in Las Vegas to the general public. Tours take about an hour, and we open ourselves up to the public because we’ve found that it’s a great way for people to get a true sense of our culture. It’s one thing to read about it, but almost everyone who has gone on our tour tells us that it isn’t until they actually visit our offices and feel our culture that they finally understand why it is so important.

It wasn’t always this way. We certainly never planned to give public tours. It’s just another example of something that evolved organically over time for us, and our employees chose to embrace it and take it to the next level.

Today, we work with more than a thousand different vendors. In the beginning, whenever a new vendor visited our offices, someone from our merchandising team would give them a tour of our operations. Over time, as word of mouth spread, we found that friends of our vendors wanted to get a tour, and eventually we started getting random requests from friends and customers to go on a tour.

In the early days, a tour would take less than ten minutes, but as more and more people started touring our offices, different groups within Zappos started to come up with different ideas on how to make each tour more and more of a WOW experience for our visitors.

Every tour is different, because you never know who is going to be in the office or what a team decided to do over the weekend to surprise our visitors. If you were to show up for a tour today, you might find a popcorn machine or a coffee machine dressed up as a robot in our lobby. As you passed through different departments, you might find an aisle of cowbells (“more cowbell?”), a makeshift bowling alley built by our software developers, employees dressed up as pirates, employees karaokeing, a nap room, a petting zoo, or a hot dog social. You might see a parade pass by because one of our departments decided that it was the perfect day to celebrate Oktoberfest. And you might say hi to our life coach (our own internal version of Tony Robbins), wear a crown, and get your picture taken and put up next to the pictures of Serena Williams or Gladys Knight when they came and toured our offices. Or you might happen to show up during our annual “Bald & Blue” day, where employees volunteer to get their heads shaved by other employees.


The Origins of Bald & Blue Day

Our annual Bald & Blue tradition started as a dare while a few of us were hanging out at a bar. An e-mail went out the next day.

Date: June 7, 2005

From: Renee N.

To: Las Vegas Zappos Employees

Subject: Bald is BEAUTIFUL

Hello All,

A challenge or should I say invitation (by someone who will remain nameless) has been put out to all the BRAVE men at Zappos to shave their heads BALD or shaved down to a number 1. Tony will be participating in shaving his head as well. We are looking for at least 30 men or more to take part in this “just because” event. So far we have 15 Brave Men.

We need some women volunteers to help shave these brave men’s heads and volunteers to bring in at least 5 clippers with the number 1 attachment. For those of us not participating in shaving our heads, please show your support by wearing your Zappos t-shirt and/or wearing your Zappos hats.

This will take place tomorrow June 8th at 12:30 PM at the patio outside the lunchroom. Please respond to me ASAP if you’d like to participate in shaving your head or if you’d like to be a volunteer.

Thanks!


Our employees know that our number one priority at Zappos is our company culture. While all of the things I just mentioned have come about organically (most of them I don’t even know about until they’ve already happened), a few of the things we do are more purposeful and planned.

For example, we have all of our employees walk through a central reception area to get in and out of the building even though there are more convenient doors located closer to the parking lot. The previous tenants had used all the doors in our building for exiting, but we decided to mark all of them for use as emergency exits only. We made this decision when we moved into our building as part of our goal to build more of a community by increasing the chances of serendipitous employee interactions.

In most companies, logging in to the computer systems requires a login and password. At Zappos, an additional step is required: a photo of a randomly selected employee is displayed, and the user is given a multiple-choice test to name that employee. Afterward, the profile and bio of that employee are shown, so that everyone can learn more about each other. Although there is no penalty for giving the wrong answer, we do keep a record of everyone’s score. Internally, we refer to this as “The Face Game.”

We also try to measure the strength of our culture through regular employee surveys by asking employees whether they agree or disagree with statements such as:

I believe that the company has a higher purpose beyond just profits.

My role at Zappos has a real purpose—it is more than just a job.

I feel that I am in control of my career path and that I am progressing in my personal and professional development at Zappos.

I consider my co-workers to be like my family and friends.

I am very happy in my job.


We’re always on the lookout for ways to improve our company culture, no matter how unconventional or counterintuitive the approach may be. For example, a research study showed that “letting workers swear at will in the workplace can benefit employees and employers.” The article went on to cite that “employees use swearing on a continuous basis, but not necessarily in a negative, abusive manner. Swearing is used as a social phenomenon to reflect solidarity and enhance group cohesiveness, or as a psychological phenomenon to release stress.” We forwarded the article to our managers.

Over time, as we focused more and more on our culture, we ultimately came to the realization that a company’s culture and a company’s brand are really just two sides of the same coin. The brand is just a lagging indicator of a company’s culture. This realization eventually led me to write the following blog post:

Your Culture Is Your Brand


Building a brand today is very different from building a brand 50 years ago. It used to be that a few people got together in a room, decided what the brand positioning was going to be, and then spent a lot of money buying advertising telling people what their brand was. And if you were able to spend enough money, then you were able to build your brand.

It’s a very different world today. With the Internet connecting everyone together, companies are becoming more and more transparent whether they like it or not. An unhappy customer or a disgruntled employee can blog about a bad experience with a company, and the story can spread like wildfire by e-mail or with tools like Twitter.

The good news is that the reverse is true as well. A great experience with a company can be read by millions of people almost instantaneously as well.

The fundamental problem is that you can’t possibly anticipate every possible touch point that could influence the perception of your company’s brand.

For example, if you happen to meet an employee of Company X at a bar, even if the employee isn’t working, how you perceive your interaction with that employee will affect how you perceive Company X, and therefore Company X’s brand. It can be a positive influence, or a negative influence. Every employee can affect your company’s brand, not just the front-line employees that are paid to talk to your customers.

At Zappos.com, we decided a long time ago that we didn’t want our brand to be just about shoes, or clothing, or even online retailing. We decided that we wanted to build our brand to be about the very best customer service and the very best customer experience. We believe that customer service shouldn’t be just a department, it should be the entire company.

Advertising can only get your brand so far. If you ask most people what the “brand” of the airline industry as a whole is (not any specific airline, but the entire industry), they will usually say something about bad customer service or bad customer experience. If you ask people what their perception of the US auto industry is today, chances are the responses you get won’t be in line with what the automakers project in their advertising.

So what’s a company to do if you can’t just buy your way into building the brand you want?

What’s the best way to build a brand for the long term?

In a word: culture.

At Zappos, our belief is that if you get the culture right, most of the other stuff—like great customer service, or building a great long-term brand, or passionate employees and customers—will happen naturally on its own.

We believe that your company’s culture and your company’s brand are really just two sides of the same coin. The brand may lag the culture at first, but eventually it will catch up.

Your culture is your brand.

So how do you build and maintain the culture that you want?

It starts with the hiring process. At Zappos, we actually do two different sets of interviews. The hiring manager and his/her team will do the standard set of interviews looking for relevant experience, technical ability, fit within the team, etc. But then our HR department does a separate set of interviews, looking purely for culture fit. Candidates have to pass both sets of interviews in order to be hired.

We’ve actually said no to a lot of very talented people that we know can make an immediate impact on our top or bottom line. But because we felt they weren’t culture fits, we were willing to sacrifice the short-term benefits in order to protect our culture (and therefore our brand) for the long term.

After hiring, the next step to building the culture is training. Everyone that is hired into our headquarters goes through the same training that our Customer Loyalty Team (call center) reps go through, regardless of department or title. You might be an accountant, or a lawyer, or a software developer—you go through the exact same training program.

It’s a 4-week training program, in which we go over company history, the importance of customer service, the long-term vision of the company, our philosophy about company culture—and then you’re actually on the phone for 2 weeks, taking calls from customers. Again, this goes back to our belief that customer service shouldn’t just be a department, it should be the entire company.

At the end of the first week of training, we make an offer to the entire class. We offer everyone $2,000 to quit (in addition to paying them for the time they’ve already worked), and it’s a standing offer until the end of the fourth week of training. We want to make sure that employees are here for more than just a paycheck. We want employees that believe in our long-term vision and want to be a part of our culture. As it turns out, on average, less than 1% of people end up taking the offer.

One of the great advantages of focusing on culture is when reporters come and visit our offices. Unlike most companies, we don’t give reporters a small list of people they’re allowed to talk to. Instead, we encourage them to wander around and talk to whoever they want. It’s our way of being as transparent as possible, which is part of our culture.

We’ve formally defined the Zappos culture in terms of 10 core values:


Deliver WOW Through Service

Embrace and Drive Change

Create Fun and a Little Weirdness

Be Adventurous, Creative, and Open-Minded

Pursue Growth and Learning

Build Open and Honest Relationships with Communication

Build a Positive Team and Family Spirit

Do More with Less

Be Passionate and Determined

Be Humble



Many companies have core values, but they don’t really commit to them. They usually sound more like something you’d read in a press release. Maybe you learn about them on day 1 of orientation, but after that it’s just a meaningless plaque on the wall of the lobby.

We believe that it’s really important to come up with core values that you can commit to. And by commit, we mean that you’re willing to hire and fire based on them. If you’re willing to do that, then you’re well on your way to building a company culture that is in line with the brand you want to build. You can let all of your employees be your brand ambassadors, not just the marketing or PR department. And they can be brand ambassadors both inside and outside the office.

At the end of the day, just remember that if you get the culture right, most of the other stuff—including building a great brand—will fall into place on its own.


Even though our core values guide us in everything we do today, we didn’t actually have any formal core values for the first six or seven years of the company’s history. It’s my fault that we didn’t do it in the early years, because it was something I’d always thought of as a very “corporate” thing to do. I resisted doing it for as long as possible.

I’m just glad that an employee finally convinced me that it was necessary to come up with core values—essentially, a formalized definition of our culture—in order for us to continue to scale and grow.

I only wish we had done it sooner.

Core Values


Back in San Francisco, Nick, Fred, and I tried to interview every prospective employee to make sure they were a culture fit for Zappos. When we moved the company to Vegas, we were hiring a lot of people very quickly due to our rapid growth. It wasn’t scalable for us to be involved with every new hire decision, but the problem was that because we had so many new employees, not everyone knew exactly what we were looking for when we said we were looking for a culture fit.

Someone from our legal department suggested that we come up with a list of core values to serve as a guide for managers to make hiring decisions, so I started jotting down the things that we were looking for. I thought about all the employees I wanted to clone because they represented the Zappos culture well, and tried to figure out what values they personified. I also thought about all the employees and ex-employees who were not culture fits, and tried to figure out where there was a values disconnect.

As I started creating the list, I realized that I needed to get everyone’s input on what our core values should be, just like we had done with the Culture Book, when we asked every employee for their thoughts on what the Zappos culture was.

The initial list had thirty-seven core values:


Culture Is Everything

WOW/Service

Trust and Faith

Idealism

Company Growth

Long Term

Personal Growth and Stretching

Achieving the Impossible

Team

Family/Relationships

Emotional Connections

Developing Your Gut

Empowerment

Ownership

Taking Initiative

Doing Whatever It Takes

Not Being Afraid to Make Mistakes

Unconventional

Bottom Up (Meets Top Down)

Partnerships

Listening

Overcommunicate

Operational Excellence

Built for Change

Continuous Incremental Improvement

Doing More with Less

Innovation

Word of Mouth

Lucky

Passion and Positivity

Personality

Openness and Honesty

Fun

Inspirational

A Little Weird

Willing to Laugh at Ourselves

Quiet Confidence and Respect


It was a long list, so we started thinking about which values were the most important and truly represented who we wanted to be. We also thought about whether we could combine some of them into a single core value.

Over the course of a year, I e-mailed the entire company several times and got a lot of suggestions and feedback on which core values were the most important to our employees.

I was surprised the process took so long, but we wanted to make sure not to rush through the process because whatever core values we eventually came up with, we wanted to be ones that we could truly embrace.

The commitment part was the most challenging part. As I mentioned in my “Your Culture Is Your Brand” blog post, a lot of corporations have “core values” or “guiding principles,” but the problem is that they’re usually very lofty sounding and they read like a press release that the marketing department put out. A lot of times, an employee might learn about them on day 1 of orientation, but then the values just end up being part of a meaningless plaque on the wall of the corporate lobby.

We wanted to make sure that didn’t happen with our core values. We wanted a list of committable core values that we were willing to hire and fire on. If we weren’t willing to do that, then they weren’t really “values.”

We eventually came up with our final list of ten core values, which we still use today:


Deliver WOW Through Service

Embrace and Drive Change

Create Fun and a Little Weirdness

Be Adventurous, Creative, and Open-Minded

Pursue Growth and Learning

Build Open and Honest Relationships with Communication

Build a Positive Team and Family Spirit

Do More with Less

Be Passionate and Determined

Be Humble


Integrity was a value that had been suggested by some employees, but I made a conscious choice to leave it out. I felt that integrity would come from us actually committing to and living up to our core values in everything we did, not just referring to them when it was convenient.

Over time, our recruiting department developed interview questions for each and every one of the core values, and we tested our commitment during the hiring process.

Be Humble is probably the core value that ends up affecting our hiring decisions the most. There are a lot of experienced, smart, and talented people we interview that we know can make an immediate impact on our top or bottom line. But a lot of them are also really egotistical, so we end up not hiring them. At most companies, the hiring manager would probably argue that we should hire such a candidate because he or she will add a lot of value to the company, which is probably why most large corporations don’t have great cultures.

Our philosophy at Zappos is that we’re willing to make short-term sacrifices (including lost revenue or profits) if we believe that the long-term benefits are worth it. Protecting the company culture and sticking to core values is a long-term benefit.

Once we had our final list of our ten core values, I sent an e-mail to the entire company describing each of them in more detail. We still refer to the original e-mail today. In fact, when new employees join the company, they are required to sign a document stating that they have read the core values document and understand that living up to the core values is part of their job expectation.


Zappos Core Values Document


THE ZAPPOS MISSION: To live and deliver WOW.


As we grow as a company, it has become more and more important to explicitly define the Zappos core values from which we develop our culture, our brand, and our business strategies. With so many new employees joining the company as we grow, we want to make sure that everyone is on the same page and acting consistently with what we want Zappos to be all about.

Over time, we will be restructuring performance evaluations so that a big part of every employee’s performance evaluation is based on how well he/she represents and makes decisions based on the Zappos core values.

While there are many subcomponents to each value, we’ve distilled the most important themes into the following 10 core values.


Deliver WOW Through Service

Embrace and Drive Change

Create Fun and a Little Weirdness

Be Adventurous, Creative, and Open-Minded

Pursue Growth and Learning

Build Open and Honest Relationships with Communication

Build a Positive Team and Family Spirit

Do More with Less

Be Passionate and Determined

Be Humble


Ideally, we want all 10 core values to be reflected in everything we do, including how we interact with each other, how we interact with our customers, and how we interact with our vendors and business partners.

There is a lot of work that lies ahead, and it will be quite some time before our 10 core values are truly reflected in how we think, how we act, and how we communicate.

As we grow, our processes and strategies may change, but we want our values to always remain the same. Our core values should always be the framework from which we make all of our decisions. Because this is our first time publishing our core values, there may be some additions or changes made over the next year, but our goal is to ultimately decide on a final list of core values to serve as the framework for how we run and grow the company.

I encourage everyone to re-examine everything that is being done at the company and ask yourself what changes can be made to better reflect our core values. For example, our employee handbook could be improved so it sounds more like “Zappos” and less like an employee handbook that you might find at another company. The forms that we use internally, our job application forms, some of our e-mail templates, parts of our Web site, and much, much more can all be improved to feel more like Zappos and better reflect our core values.

So the challenge to everyone is this: Make at least one improvement every week that makes Zappos better reflect our core values.

The improvements don’t have to be dramatic—it can be as simple as adding in an extra sentence or two to a form to make it more fun, for example. But if every employee made just one small improvement every week to better reflect our core values, then by the end of this year we will have over 50,000 small changes that collectively will be a very dramatic improvement compared to where we are today.

A brief description of each of the 10 core values is below.


Deliver WOW Through Service

At Zappos, anything worth doing is worth doing with WOW.

WOW is such a short, simple word, but it really encompasses a lot of things. To WOW, you must differentiate yourself, which means do something a little unconventional and innovative. You must do something that’s above and beyond what’s expected. And whatever you do must have an emotional impact on the receiver. We are not an average company, our service is not average, and we don’t want our people to be average. We expect every employee to deliver WOW.

Whether internally with co-workers or externally with our customers and partners, delivering WOW results in word of mouth. Our philosophy at Zappos is to WOW with service and experience, not with anything that relates directly to monetary compensation (for example, we don’t offer blanket discounts or promotions to customers).

We seek to WOW our customers, our co-workers, our vendors, our partners, and in the long run, our investors.

Ask yourself: What are things you can improve upon in your work or attitude to WOW more people? Have you WOWed at least one person today?

Deliver WOW Through Service by Martha C.

In 1984, I had spent seven weeks traveling throughout Europe. By the time I got to London, my last stop before returning to the States, I had no money left except for my lucky US dollar and a handful of foreign coins at the bottom of my handbag.


Thirsty, I grabbed a soda from the snack bar and read the sign: FOREIGN MONEY ACCEPTED. By the time I reached the front of the register line, I had almost downed the whole can when I spotted another sign: NO FOREIGN COINS. PAPER CURRENCY ONLY. My attempt to convince the cashier to take all my coins was futile and the last thing I wanted to do was part with my lucky dollar.


Suddenly, the gentleman behind me reached over and paid for my soda. I thanked him and tried giving him all my coins but he refused. He just asked that I start doing random acts of kindness for others. That one incident with a stranger in the London airport stayed with me forever.


Fast-forwarding to last Tuesday morning, 2008, I just finished checking off my long shopping list at Walgreens and stepped up to the register. Two people who only had a few items got in line behind me so naturally I let them go first. When it was my turn, the cashier was about a third of the way through my items when an older gentleman filed in line. Two cans of peanuts, salve, and Chapstick were in his hands.


I turned to him and asked him to give them to me. With a puzzled look on his face, he asked why. I had completely meant to say, It’s a random act of kindness, but instead the words “It’s a random act of WOWness” came out of my mouth. Since working at Zappos, the word WOW replaced kind on its own. Rather than correct what I said, I just went with it. The cashier scanned and placed the items in a bag and handed it to the gentleman.


He looked at me and said, “Tell me about this ‘random act of WOWness.’ ” He listened to my story about the stranger in London, profusely thanked me, and left the store. Now it was the cashier’s turn to look at me strangely. He too wanted to know about “random acts of WOWness” and I explained how I work at Zappos and one of our core values is to WOW our customers.



Leaving that store, I had an incredible feeling. Not only did I share WOWness, I shared it with two people and could only hope they might pay it forward as well someday.


A few days later, on my way home from Zappos after my night shift, I walked in to the same Walgreens at 7:00 AM. I had barely stepped foot into the store when I heard, “Hi Martha.” I realized it was the same cashier from the other day.


Surprised, I said, “I can’t believe you remember my name.” He replied, “I wrote your name down from the credit card receipt, because I didn’t want to forget the person that taught me about ‘random acts of WOW and kindness.’ I’ve told others about it too!”


The funny thing was, he was the one now WOWing me in return.

Embrace and Drive Change

Part of being in a growing company is that change is constant. For some people, especially those who come from bigger companies, the constant change can be somewhat unsettling at first. If you are not prepared to deal with constant change, then you probably are not a good fit for the company.

We must all learn not only to not fear change, but to embrace it enthusiastically and, perhaps even more important, encourage and drive it. We must always plan for and be prepared for constant change.

Although change can and will come from all directions, it’s important that most of the changes in the company are driven from the bottom up—from the people who are on the front lines, closer to the customers and/or issues.

Never accept or be too comfortable with the status quo, because the companies that get into trouble are historically the ones that aren’t able to adapt to change and respond quickly enough.

We are ever evolving. If we want to continue to stay ahead of our competition, we must continually change and keep them guessing. Others can copy our images, our shipping, and the overall look of our Web site, but they cannot copy our people, our culture, or our service. And they will not be able to evolve as fast as we can as long as embracing constant change is part of our culture.

Ask yourself: How do you plan and prepare for change? Do you view new challenges optimistically? Do you encourage and drive change? How do you encourage more change to be driven from the bottom up?

Are you empowering your direct reports to drive change?

The Power of 1%

Blog post by Alfred L, CFO/COO, January 2009


It was the best of times and it was the worst of times.

—A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens

On CNBC Reports 2008, Maria Bartiromo quoted Charles Dickens, noting that, while Dickens was referring to the French Revolution, he could have easily been talking about 2008.


No doubt, 2008 was a very challenging year, starting out with a weak economic and retail environment that degraded slowly in the first half of the year and then fell off a cliff in the second half of the year. Depending on what reports you read, online e-commerce was down 3–5% this holiday season, marking the first time e-commerce didn’t grow. Reading about these not-so-positive reports just goes to show how very lucky we are at Zappos, because we were able to ride through these rocky times and produce pretty incredible results.


No, things weren’t perfect, but 2008 was still a great year for us! Official results have to wait until our finance team closes the books and releases the audited financials in early March, but we managed to grow our business over last year and during the holiday season (when e-commerce was down), exceeded $1B in gross merchandise sales. And by Doing More With Less, we kept ourselves profitable and cash-positive, all the while having a lot of fun serving our customers!


We can reminisce about 2008, but now that 2009 is here and we’re back from some much-needed downtime, it’s time to get our A-game back on. We’ll be going over our goals and “official” plans as soon as our board approves them, but even before that “officially” happens, we already know what we need to do.


One thing I encourage you to do is to refer back to our core values document and make at least one improvement every week that makes Zappos better. Ideally, we would do this every single day. It sounds daunting, but remember improvements don’t have to be dramatic. Think about what it means to improve just 1% per day and build upon that every single day. Doing so has a dramatic effect and will make us 37x better, not 365% (3.65x) better, at the end of the year.


Wake up every day and ask yourself not only what is the 1% improvement I can change to make Zappos better, but also what is the 1% improvement I can change to make myself better personally and professionally. In the end we, as Zappos, can’t grow unless we, as individuals, grow too.


Imagine yourself making 1% changes every day that compound and consequently make you and Zappos 37x better by the end of the year. Imagine if every employee at Zappos was to do the same. Imagine how much better you, Zappos, and the world will be next year.


It won’t be easy and 2009 will no doubt present its own set of challenges, but we positively will get through it. Have a great and happy 2009!


PS: This is for the math geeks. If you start out with $100 at the beginning of the year and you were able to increase what you have by 1% every single day, at the end of the year, you would have $3,778.34 = $100 * (1 + 1%) ^ 365. That is 37.78x what you had at the beginning of the year. Get that 1% every single day!


PPS: Yes, I am a math geek. No, I wasn’t cool enough to join the football team, so I joined the math team. Thanks for putting up with me.

Create Fun and a Little Weirdness

One of the things that makes Zappos different from a lot of other companies is that we value being fun and being a little weird. We don’t want to become one of those big companies that feel corporate and boring. We want to be able to laugh at ourselves. We look for both fun and humor in our daily work.

This means that many things we do might be a little unconventional—or else it wouldn’t be a little weird. We’re not looking for crazy or extreme weirdness though. We want just a touch of weirdness to make life more interesting and fun for everyone. We want the company to have a unique and memorable personality.

Our company culture is what makes us successful, and in our culture we celebrate and embrace our diversity and each person’s individuality. We want people to express their personality in their work. To outsiders, that might come across as inconsistent or weird. But the consistency is in our belief that we function best when we can be ourselves. We want the weirdness in each of us to be expressed in our interactions with each other and in our work.

One of the side effects of encouraging weirdness is that it encourages people to think outside the box and be more innovative. When you combine a little weirdness with making sure everyone is also having fun at work, it ends up being a win–win for everyone: Employees are more engaged in the work that they do, and the company as a whole becomes more innovative.

Ask yourself: What can we do to be a little weird and differentiate ourselves from everyone else? What can we do that’s both fun and a little weird? How much fun do you have in your job, and what can you do to make it more fun? What do you do to make your co-workers’ jobs fun as well?

Fun and a Little Weird: Live Chat

A blog post by Todd, a Zappos customer

The reason I was testing out Zappos live chat was because I am “Cruiser in Chief” of a beach cruiser store, and I was curious how Zappos would handle my chat. Zappos is known for service… and for letting their service agents “be themselves.” I put this to the test tonight and threw a curveball or two at the guy helping me in a live chat. I used the name “Timmy” as my alias and asked a totally random question about a random product. See actual chat log below. Zappos rocks! I could not even make this stuff up, I swear.


You are now chatting with Jonathan.


Jonathan: Hello Timmy. How can I help you?



Timmy: Do you know how wide the G-Shock Atomic Solar—AWG101 SKU #7403774 is?


Timmy: I mean, how big a wrist it would fit?


Timmy: Timmy has a big fat wrist


Timmy: Timmy need watch grande


Jonathan: I’ll see what I can find out for Timmy.


Timmy: Awesome. And can we please continue to talk about Timmy in the 3rd person? Timmy likes to boost Timmy’s ego by talking about Timmy that way


Jonathan: Jonathan would be happy to neglect the use of pronouns for the duration of this conversation.


Timmy: Jonathan and Timmy shall get along just fine


Jonathan: Will Timmy be able to measure Timmy’s wrist?


Timmy: Timmy’s wrist is big, but not Biggie-Smalls big. Timmy doesn’t have the required measurement instruments.


Timmy: Timmy is 6′4″ 220lbs if that helps Jonathan


Jonathan: Luckily, that is roughly the size of Jonathan’s brother, so that does help.


Jonathan: Jonathan thinks that this watch will work out well for Timmy. The watch’s circumference is 9 inches, so it will probably fit around Timmy’s wrist.


Timmy: Ok cool


Timmy: Do your watches and stuff have free return shipping like your Zapatos?



Timmy: In case Timmy wants another one or something



Jonathan: And if it doesn’t work out, as long as the watch is in its original condition and in the original packaging, Timmy has 365 days to return Timmy’s order. We will even pay for the return shipping! As always, our shipping to Timmy will be free.


Timmy: Timmy thanks Jonathan for good help


Jonathan: Jonathan welcomes Timmy.


Jonathan: It’s Jonathan’s pleasure!


Jonathan: Can Jonathan do anything more for Timmy?


Timmy: No that is all Timmy needs


Timmy: Timmy happy


Jonathan: Good. Does Timmy have an account set up with Zappos yet?


Jonathan: Jonathan will upgrade Timmy’s account.


Timmy: Yes Timmy is repeat shopper


Timmy: But “Timmy” is my alter ego and not my actual name


Jonathan: Well, what is “Timmy’s” e-mail address? I’ll hook you up.


Timmy: Timmy has placed orders using txxxxxx@gmail.com in the past


Jonathan: All right TODD!



Jonathan:


Jonathan: I’m going to upgrade your account to VIP status! This will ensure that all future orders go out with 1-business-day shipping free of charge!


Jonathan: Just place your future orders at http://vip.zappos.com.


Timmy: Timmy likey!


Jonathan: Good. Good…


Jonathan: Let Jonathan know if there is anything else that Jonathan can do for Timmy.


Timmy: Ok, Timmy ok now. Timmy time to go shopping!


Jonathan: Have fun!

Be Adventurous, Creative, and Open-Minded


At Zappos, we think it’s important for people and the company as a whole to be bold and daring (but not reckless). We want everyone to not be afraid to take risks and to not be afraid to make mistakes, because if people aren’t making mistakes then that means they’re not taking enough risks. Over time, we want everyone to develop his/her gut about business decisions. We want people to develop and improve their decision-making skills. We encourage people to make mistakes as long as they learn from them.

We never want to become complacent and accept the status quo just because that’s the way things have always been done. We should always be seeking adventure and having fun exploring new possibilities. By having the freedom to be creative in our solutions, we end up making our own luck. We approach situations and challenges with an open mind.

Sometimes our sense of adventure and creativity causes us to be unconventional in our solutions (because we have the freedom to think outside the box), but that’s what allows us to rise above and stay ahead of the competition.

Ask yourself: Are you taking enough risks? Are you afraid of making mistakes? Do you push yourself outside of your comfort zone? Is there a sense of adventure and creativity in the work that you do? What are some creative things that you can contribute to Zappos? Do you approach situations and challenges with an open mind?

Be Adventurous, Creative, and Open-Minded

by Christa F. (Recruiting Manager)

When I joined Zappos in December of 2004, I was leaving behind the staffing industry after eight years of working with two very large and very corporate staffing companies. In that world, Complacency and Status Quo reigned, Adventure and Fun having long ago been banished from the kingdom, if they had ever been there at all. I had been slowly descending to final burnout and had decided I never wanted to interview another person again. If you noticed my title and are thinking, “Huh, that seems… odd,” don’t worry, this story has a happy ending.


I saw that Zappos.com had a job opening for an HR Generalist and applied. This was the company everyone was talking about—the new, hip, fun, cool company that had just moved to town from San Francisco. And while that was definitely interesting and exciting, I may have mentioned I really wanted to get out of recruiting.


Somehow the stars aligned and I got the job! A few days into my second week, my manager tentatively approached me to let me know that given my background, my first big project was—drumroll please—yep, to help set up a recruiting process and start recruiting. Sigh…


You could probably guess I wasn’t thrilled at first, but here’s what I quickly came to realize—my problem with recruiting wasn’t the actual function of recruiting, it was the lack of creativity and adventure in my work that had been “killing me softly.”


At Zappos, as with all the core values, Being Adventurous, Creative, and Open-Minded is not a recommendation; it’s the way we live. And if you think you can’t apply this or other core values to traditionally stodgy, policy-driven, and boring departments (indeed, HR is probably at the top of that list) within your company, think again.


When we were working to create our recruiting and screening process, we were trying to figure out not only how to assess whether or not candidates would be a match with our core values, but also how we were going to demonstrate and show—infuse—our core values into our process. Talk about having to be creative, be willing to take some risks, and be open-minded!


For example, one of the biggest challenges on the plate was hiring a large volume of Customer Loyalty Team representatives very quickly. With a team of three at the time, we just weren’t able to interview fast enough. Tony had a crazy idea, as he is wont to do, and suggested that instead of doing just a traditional job fair to get a lot of people in, why not do some speed dating?


My first reaction was hell no, this will never work, and I am going to need a month to figure this out and get it right. But in the spirit of being open-minded, and honestly, not having a better plan, we gave it a try. We started with the basics: We placed an ad in the paper, candidates came in to listen to a presentation on Zappos and the job details, and then they met with six Zappos employees for five minutes each to interview. Our intention was to weed out folks who definitely weren’t going to be a fit quickly and then bring the rest back for sit-down interviews.


It was far from perfect but it was a start. From there, the work of fine-tuning and making the process more and more effective and Zappos-like was an exhilarating challenge. Over the year, we added things like dance music, drinks, and munchies to the presentation. We made it interactive and surprising by making it part informative, part stand-up comedy. We had folks introduce themselves to the group and share a fun fact (not a bad way to see who the outgoing leaders are in the group) and also did an “Oprah” moment where we gave away prizes (Zappos schwag) to “lucky audience members.” We added an old-fashioned kitchen timer to the interview/dating part and when the five minutes was up and the candidates were moving to the next interviewer, we let them know with the buzzzzzzzzzz and a chorus of “SWITCH!!!!!”



The energy and excitement from the growing recruiting team on how to make the job fair better, more effective, more fun, and more reflective of the Zappos culture was overwhelming. It quickly spilled over into everything we did and manifested in things like themed interview rooms where candidates would be more likely to relax, respond to questions truthfully, and show their own personality and creativity.



It even showed up in new hire orientation. As part of the paperwork we cover, one deals with the expectations for the four-week new hire class—which are essentially a list of reasons a person might get fired in those first weeks. Talk about a buzz kill on the first day. Yes, the information is important and needs to be shared, but how do we do it in a Zappos way? Thanks to two loyal Saturday Night Live watchers on my team, we decided to “steal” a few well-known and loved characters from the show and perform skits to convey the information but in a very over-the-top and funny way.


There are many more examples I could give but suffice it to say that five years later, when I look at my team and what we have done at Zappos, I am so very proud and so very fulfilled in our work. The problem when someone feels burned out, bored, unchallenged, or stifled by their work is not the job itself but rather the environment and playground rules given to them to do the job at hand.


Let your employees take risks and try new things. Some will work and some won’t and that is okay. Let your employees bring all of themselves to their job. You may have an amazingly talented software engineer who is also a rockin’ musician—let him or her find an outlet for this passion at work too.


I think when people say they dread going into work on Monday morning, it’s because they know they are leaving a piece of themselves at home. Why not see what happens when you challenge your employees to bring all of their talents to their job and reward them not for doing it just like everyone else, but for pushing the envelope, being adventurous, creative, and open-minded, and trying new things?


So you see, there’s always a happy ending, right? I am still in recruiting, I interview people on a daily basis, and I absolutely love it!

Pursue Growth and Learning


At Zappos, we think it’s important for employees to grow both personally and professionally. It’s important to constantly challenge and stretch yourself, and not be stuck in a job where you don’t feel like you are growing or learning.

We believe that inside every employee is more potential than even the employee himself/herself realizes. Our goal is to help employees unlock that potential. But it has to be a joint effort: You have to want to challenge and stretch yourself in order for it to happen.

If you’ve been at Zappos for more than a few months, one thing is clear: Zappos is growing. We grow because we take on new challenges, and we face even more new challenges because we’re growing. It’s an endless cycle, and it’s a good thing: it’s the only way for a company to survive. But it can also at times feel risky, stressful, and confusing.

Sometimes it may seem that new problems crop up as fast as we solve the old ones (sometimes faster!), but that just means that we’re moving—that we’re getting better and stronger. Anyone who wants to compete with us has to learn the same things, so problems are just mile markers. Each one we pass means we’ve gotten better.

Yet no matter how much better we get, we’ll always have hard work to do, we’ll never be done, and we’ll never “get it right.”

That may seem negative, but it’s not: we’ll do our best to “get it right,” and then do it again when we find out that things have changed. That is the cycle of growth, and like it or not, that cycle won’t stop.

It’s hard… but if we weren’t doing something hard, then we’d have no business. The only reason we aren’t swamped by our competition is because what we do is hard, and we do it better than anyone else. If it ever gets too easy, start looking for a tidal wave of competition to wash us away.

It may seem sometimes like we don’t know what we’re doing. And it’s true: we don’t. That’s a bit scary, but you can take comfort in knowing that nobody else knows how to do what we’re doing either. If they did, they’d be the Web’s most popular shoe store. Sure, people have done parts of what we do before, but what we’ve learned over the years at Zappos is that the devil is in the details. And that’s where we’re breaking new ground.

So there are no experts in what we’re doing. Except for us: we are becoming experts as we do this. And for anyone we bring on board, the best expertise they can bring is expertise at learning and adapting and figuring new things out—helping the company grow, and in the process they will also be growing themselves.

Ask yourself: How do you grow personally? How do you grow professionally? Are you a better person today than you were yesterday? How do you get your co-workers and direct reports to grow personally? How do you get your co-workers and direct reports to grow professionally? How do you challenge and stretch yourself? Are you learning something every day? What is your vision for where you want to go? How do you get the company as a whole to grow? Are you doing everything you can to promote company growth, and at the same time are you helping others understand the growth? Do you understand the company vision?

Pursue Growth and Learning

by Maura S.

When I began working at Zappos six years ago, I had no plans to make it a career. I happened to live in San Francisco, trying to get a full-time job in the museum world. It wasn’t working out too well, so I applied to answer phones so I could pay rent.



Looking back, it was simply a job. Now that job has turned into something so much more meaningful.


I knew Zappos was a great place to work right away because of two things: the great people I got to spend my day with, and their fantastic philosophy on customer service. But I don’t really think I understood how special this company was until I made a huge leap of faith and moved with them to Las Vegas in April 2004.



The Zappos Core Values were sent out to us in 2006. We knew we had a unique culture and now we had something to reference, something that we all contributed to, something to which we said, “Yes! This is what we believe in.”


The Core Values weren’t just for the office; they were a way of life. I loved and identified with them all, but I immediately honed in on Core Value 5: Pursue Growth and Learning.


By that time I had been with the company two and a half years. In that short time I had been pushed into management positions, when I had no experience and wasn’t looking for that in a job. In hindsight, I’m thankful they pushed me there.


I knew that Zappos trusted me, maybe even before I could trust myself in certain roles. Because of that, I was able to learn and grow by leaps and bounds, both personally and professionally.



After the core values came out, I really started to “pursue” all of the growth and learning around me. I realized how lucky I was to work in such a supportive environment, where I could come up with ideas and know I’ve been already given the go-ahead to “just do.”


I became more confident and sure of my role as a leader in the company. I pushed myself to start speaking on behalf of Zappos at conferences, something that I would’ve been horrified to do five years ago. Now I love it.


I was learning and growing not only within the Zappos walls, but also in my personal life. I was able to set goals and buy a house on my own. As a kid I was an avid reader, but in college I lost my zest for reading. Now I can’t keep up with all the wonderful books out there.


I’ve also pushed myself to get back into a healthy lifestyle. I’ve run five half marathons and am currently training for my first full in December (sponsored by Zappos!). I’ve traveled to Asia to go scuba diving, Central America to climb a volcano, and camped on one to watch the neighboring one erupt. Happiness!



It’s amazing to look back on the last six years and imagine the twenty-five-year-old I was, and see how much I’ve grown and changed. Zappos has been a huge part of that growth and every day I walk in to work, I can’t wait to learn more.

Build Open and Honest Relationships With Communication


Fundamentally, we believe that openness and honesty make for the best relationships because that leads to trust and faith. We value strong relationships in all areas: with managers, direct reports, customers (internal and external), vendors, business partners, team members, and co-workers.

Strong, positive relationships that are open and honest are a big part of what differentiates Zappos from most other companies. Strong relationships allow us to accomplish much more than we would be able to otherwise.

A key ingredient in strong relationships is to develop emotional connections. It’s important to always act with integrity in your relationships, to be compassionate, friendly, loyal, and to make sure that you do the right thing and treat your relationships well. The hardest thing to do is to build trust, but if the trust exists, you can accomplish so much more.

In any relationship, it’s important to be a good listener as well as a good communicator. Open, honest communication is the best foundation for any relationship, but remember that at the end of the day it’s not what you say or what you do, but how you make people feel that matters the most. In order for someone to feel good about a relationship, they must know that the other person truly cares about them, both personally and professionally.

At Zappos, we embrace diversity in thoughts, opinions, and backgrounds. The more widespread and diverse your relationships are, the bigger the positive impact you can make on the company, and the more valuable you will be to the company. It is critical for relationship-building to have effective, open, and honest communication.

As the company grows, communication becomes more and more important, because everyone needs to understand how his/her team connects to the big picture of what we’re trying to accomplish.

Communication is always one of the weakest spots in any organization, no matter how good the communication is. We want everyone to always try to go the extra mile in encouraging thorough, complete, and effective communication.

Ask yourself: How much do people enjoy working with you? How can you improve those relationships? What new relationships can you build throughout the company beyond just the co-workers that you work with on a daily basis? How do you WOW the people that you have relationships with? How can you make your relationships more open and honest? How can you do a better job of communicating with everyone?


Build a Positive Team and Family Spirit


At Zappos, we place a lot of emphasis on our culture because we are both a team and a family. We want to create an environment that is friendly, warm, and exciting. We encourage diversity in ideas, opinions, and points of view.

The best leaders are those that lead by example and are both team followers as well as team leaders. We believe that in general, the best ideas and decisions are made from the bottom up, meaning by those on the front lines that are closest to the issues and/or the customers. The role of a manager is to remove obstacles and enable his/her direct reports to succeed. This means the best leaders are servant-leaders. They serve those they lead.

The best team members take initiative when they notice issues so that the team and the company can succeed. The best team members take ownership of issues and collaborate with other team members whenever challenges arise.

The best team members have a positive influence on one another and everyone they encounter. They strive to eliminate any kind of cynicism and negative interactions. Instead, the best team members are those that strive to create harmony with each other and whoever else they interact with.

We believe that the best teams are those that not only work with each other, but also interact with each other outside the office environment. Many of the company’s best ideas have been the direct result of informal interactions outside of the office.

For example, the idea for our culture book came about from a casual discussion outside the office.

We are more than just a team, though—we are a family. We watch out for each other, care for each other, and go above and beyond for each other because we believe in each other and we trust each other. We work together but we also play together. Our bonds go far beyond the typical “co-worker” relationships found at most other companies.

Ask yourself: How do you encourage more teamwork? How do you encourage more people to take initiative? How do you encourage more people to take ownership? What can you do with your team members so that you feel both like a family and a team? How can you build stronger relationships with your team members both inside and outside the office? Do you instill a sense of team and family not just within your department, but across the entire company? Do you exemplify a positive team spirit?

Build a Positive Team and Family Spirit

by Robin P.

My husband passed away under tragic circumstances in December of 2007. I couldn’t begin to think of what that was going to mean for our children, our family, or for me.


When I first heard the news, I was numb, but I needed to make a call. Strangely enough, the call wasn’t to an immediate family member. It was to my employer, Zappos.com. That one action made me realize the strong connection I felt with my co-workers and the Zappos culture. It essentially was my home away from home.


When my senior manager received my hysterical call, she showed great compassion and gave sound advice to calm me. She assured that I shouldn’t be concerned with anything else but to take care of myself and my family, and that—day or night—I should call if I needed anything. After she gave me every single one of her phone numbers, I knew she meant it.


As much as Zappos meant to me before, the things they did after my husband passed amazed and humbled me. I was reassured that I shouldn’t feel pressure to return to work as soon as possible. They even volunteered to cater the reception for my husband’s service. My visiting family had never heard of these kinds of gestures given by a workplace. I just smiled and said, “Wonderful. That’s what Zappos is.”


When I returned to work, I was nervous, unsure of how my co-workers would act around me. But I wasn’t anxious for long. There was always someone there to listen, offer consoling words, sit with me as I released my tears, or just give a hug. Co-workers and managers alike allowed me time to heal and gave me the strength I needed to continue as a contributing and functioning member of the team.


In the end, the most important contributions from my extended family at Zappos were support and friendship. Zappos was my refuge and healing place that gave me everything I needed to continue on with my life.

Do More with Less


Zappos has always been about being able to do more with less. While we may be casual in our interactions with each other, we are focused and serious about the operations of our business. We believe in hard work and putting in the extra effort to get things done.

We believe in operational excellence, and realize that there is always room for improvement in everything we do. This means that our work is never done. In order to stay ahead of the competition (or would-be competition), we need to continuously innovate as well as make incremental improvements to our operations, always striving to make ourselves more efficient, always trying to figure out how to do something better. We use mistakes as learning opportunities.

We must never lose our sense of urgency in making improvements. We must never settle for “good enough,” because good is the enemy of great, and our goal is to not only become a great company, but to become the greatest service company in the world. We set and exceed our own high standards, constantly raising the bar for competitors and for ourselves.

Ask yourself: How can you do what you’re doing more efficiently? How can your department become more efficient? How can the company as a whole become more efficient? How can you personally help the company become more efficient?

Do More with Less by Vanessa L.

I joined Zappos in 2007 during a hard patch in my life. I went to a temp agency looking for work and was told there was a company that might fit me really well. The minute I walked through those doors, my life had changed.


I remember thinking the core values were simple, easy to follow, and incredibly impactful. Of the ten, I’ve integrated “Do More With Less” into my life in the most ways.


Around my first Christmas working at Zappos, I had no family, no car, no phone, no money, and nowhere to go for the holidays. In my stubborn head I wanted to enjoy Christmas, even if it was all by myself. I decided I’d walk to the store and buy one small holiday item every day until Christmas Eve, and then I’d cook up a little feast for myself.



I ended up buying two yams on sale for 39 cents. That was as far as my shopping went. Christmas Eve came and I made my yams. I had neither spices nor even a pan in which to cook them. I found some tinfoil to use instead.



Opening up my cabinet, I saw a package of hot cocoa powder with marshmallows. I sifted the package, picked out all the little marshmallows, cleansed them in water, and put them in the yams for flavor.



I ate it all, even though it was not tasty. But the funny thing was… I was so incredibly happy in that moment. I’ll never forget how content I felt that night. I could’ve been miserable and cried myself to sleep because I was alone during the holidays, a time I’m used to spending with family and a whole table full of food.


I felt Do More With Less got me through rough patches in life and made me think outside the box in my personal and professional life. There’s never one way to do things, but an incredible amount of ways to get things done. It takes an open and creative mind to find, invent, and execute them. I’ve been more creative, passionate, and resourceful here at Zappos than anywhere else.


Roadblocks aren’t a dead end here. They’re a welcome challenge.



Thinking back to when I made those yams years ago, doing more with less, I now know that any issue arising in life is a welcome challenge where I can learn and grow. Since that time, I’ve gained back material possessions like a phone, car, home, and steady supply of groceries (including yams!).



I know it’s not material possessions that generate my happiness but one thing I have to admit… I still enjoy yams with freeze-dried marshmallows in packets!

Be Passionate and Determined


Passion is the fuel that drives ourselves and our company forward. We value passion, determination, perseverance, and the sense of urgency.

We are inspired because we believe in what we are doing and where we are going. We don’t take “no” or “that’ll never work” for an answer, because if we had, Zappos would never have started in the first place.

Passion and determination are contagious. We believe in having a positive and optimistic (but realistic) attitude about everything we do, because we realize that this inspires others to have the same attitude.

There is excitement in knowing that everyone you work with has a tremendous impact on a larger dream and vision, and you can see that impact day in and day out.

Ask yourself: Are you passionate about the company? Are you passionate about your work? Do you love what you do and who you work with? Are you happy here? Are you inspired? Do you believe in what we are doing and where we are going? Is this the place for you?

Be Passionate and Determined

by Dr. Vik

I met with one of our Customer Loyalty reps a couple of years back. She was young, twenty-one to be exact, and was tired of throwing her money down the tubes in an apartment she was renting. So she set her sights on buying a house.



She and her husband had bills and credit cards piled so high, they didn’t have much left over. All they could save was $25 a month toward the purchase of their future house. As little as that was, we decided it was the routine of saving that was the most important thing. So they began at a starting point that was manageable, and not so aggressive they’d want to quit.



After the thirty days were up, she told me it was so easy to save the $25, she wanted to raise the amount. And since her new routine of saving was pretty easy, they decided they’d start making a dent in other bills they had, like student loans. Albeit change wasn’t felt overnight, they started to make headway and progress was made just the same.



She’d give updates every so often and one day, after a couple of years had passed, she came in to tell me all their bills were paid off and they had just purchased a new home. Some time after, they even bought a boat for recreation.



Their success wasn’t immediate but her passion and determination to work their plan were impressive to say the least. Her takeaway from the whole process is that they were in total control of their future and their life—they just needed to make a plan of their own choosing, and work it through to completion.

Be Humble


While we have grown quickly in the past, we recognize that there are always challenges ahead to tackle. We believe that no matter what happens, we should always be respectful of everyone.

While we celebrate our individual and team successes, we are not arrogant nor do we treat others differently from how we would want to be treated. Instead, we carry ourselves with a quiet confidence, because we believe that in the long run our character will speak for itself.

Ask yourself: Are you humble when talking about your accomplishments? Are you humble when talking about the company’s accomplishments? Do you treat both large and small vendors with the same amount of respect that they treat you?


It’s more fun to talk with someone who doesn’t use long difficult

words but rather short easy words like “What about lunch?”

—Winnie-the-Pooh

One of our other goals when we came up with our ten core values was to create a list that was unique to Zappos and didn’t sound like every other company. No two company cultures are exactly alike, yet the core values for a lot of corporations sound very similar. In most cases, you wouldn’t be able to identify the company just by looking at their list of core values.

Doing a Google search for each of your company’s core values can serve as a good test for whether your company’s core values are unique. If you Google any of our core values, you’ll find that Zappos always shows up somewhere, and in most cases we are the number one search result.

Ultimately, though, it’s not the Google search results that matter. What matters is that each of the core values becomes a natural part of employees’ everyday language and way of thinking. Committable core values that are truly integrated into a company’s operations can align an entire organization and serve as a guide for employees to make their own decisions.

I’m not suggesting that other companies should adopt our core values at Zappos. In most cases, that would be a huge mistake. Our core values are simply the core values that make sense for us.

In the books Good to Great and Tribal Leadership, the authors looked at what characteristics separated the great companies from the good ones. One of the most important ingredients they found was a strong company culture. Core values are essentially a formalized definition of a company’s culture.

As it turns out, it doesn’t actually matter what your company’s core values are. What matters is that you have them and that you commit to them. What’s important is the alignment that you get from them when they become the default way of thinking for the entire organization.

Your personal core values define who you are, and a company’s core values ultimately define the company’s character and brand.


For individuals, character is destiny.

For organizations, culture is destiny.

Vendor Relations

by Fred

I consider vendor relationships to be one of the key components to Zappos’s success. Without them, we wouldn’t be where we are today. To give some perspective, it can be helpful to start from the beginning, and in this case, it began with a background check.



My career in retail began in Bellevue, Washington, on the men’s shoe floor at Nordstrom. Over the course of eight years, I worked my way up through the ranks until I achieved a buyer role in San Francisco, in one of the largest stores in the company. While there, I worked with many buyers of varying styles and interacted with many vendors. I witnessed some ugly and adversarial relationships; I witnessed some positive and collaborative relationships. And, contrary to popular belief, it was the nice guys who always came out on top.



I was still at Nordstrom on that fateful day in 1999 when I answered the call from Nick. I had lunch with Nick, Tony, and Alfred at Mel’s Diner to discuss the potential of creating direct (drop ship) relationships with footwear vendors to sell shoes online. At the time, this was a novel concept and a bit risky. Nordstrom was a stable company, and I had a good job, but being the gambling man that I am, I decided to bet it all on the opportunity to help build something from the ground up. I took a leap of faith.



I knew from the beginning that we needed to have strong and positive partnerships with our vendors in order to be successful. At Nordstrom, I saw buyers abuse their vendors daily and use their positions of power for short-term wins; these buyers ultimately failed in the long run. Then there were the buyers who partnered closely with their vendors, treated them with respect, and created long-term opportunities; these buyers always had the best business. I decided early in my career that I would create relationships and opportunities that would stand the test of time, and I was fortunate that I could rely on many of the relationships I’d already built.



The typical industry approach is to treat vendors like the enemy. Show them no respect, don’t return their phone calls, make them wait for scheduled appointments, and make them buy the meals. Scream at them, blame them, abuse them… anything to get as much as possible and squeeze out every last dime. In fact, I know of a time when, after a vendor sold to an independent’s competitor, the buyer became so upset that he literally pulled down his pants and demanded the vendor kiss his ass!



It’s a wonder people don’t realize that business doesn’t have to be done this way. Ultimately, each party is out for the same thing: to take care of the customers, grow the business, and be profitable. In the long run, it doesn’t behoove either party if there’s only one winner. If vendors can’t make a profit then they don’t have money to invest in research and development, which in turn means that the products they bring to market will be less inspiring to customers, which in turn detriments the retailer’s business because customers aren’t inspired to buy. People want to cut costs and negotiate aggressively because there’s a limited amount of profit to be shared by both sides. As a result of this “death spiral,” most retailers fail.



We wanted Zappos to be different by creating collaborative relationships in which both parties share the risks, as well as the rewards. We found it much easier to create alliances when partners align themselves to the same vision and commit to accountability, knowing we’ll all benefit from achieving our goals. Not only does this approach get both sides pulling in the same direction, it creates an environment and culture where people are inspired to get up every day, passionate for what they do. It creates empowerment and control of the business, as well as a sense of pride and ownership. It makes people want to do more because they know their contribution means something.



We implement this partnership mentality in many ways at Zappos, but it all begins with the Golden Rule: Treat others as you’d like to be treated. When vendors fly to visit our offices in Las Vegas, they are greeted at the airport by one of our Zappos shuttles. When they arrive at our offices, their buyer welcomes them as we take their sample bags off their hands so we can deliver them to the meeting room. If it’s their first time visiting our office, we give them a tour. We offer them drinks and snacks, basically anything we can do to make them feel comfortable. This is all far from industry standard, but if we were in their position, I’m sure we wouldn’t mind being treated this way.



The same mentality applies to communication with our vendors. If they call, we try to return their call the same day. If they e-mail, we try to respond within a few hours. We realize the importance of communication, and if our partners are trying to reach us, we need to be responsive. Our customers expect this type of responsiveness from us, and so should our vendors.



Early on in Zappos, because of the size of our business, we realized we were going to need help running it. There was just no way we could afford to staff all the buyers needed to manage the number of styles and sizes in our selection. I’ll never forget the afternoon I turned my chair around and asked Tony what he thought about giving vendors access to the same information as our buyers. Traditionally in retail, information is hoarded, kept secret, and used as leverage against the vendors to get more out of them. Retailers wouldn’t want a vendor to know how well they’re doing so they can demand more. But if we created true transparency in our business, not only would they help us, they’d benefit as well.



Not too long after I proposed the idea to Tony, he spun back around and said, “Were you thinking about something like this?” He created the beginning of what we now refer to as “the extranet.” It does exactly what we had discussed. It allows the vendors complete visibility into our business. They’re able to see inventory levels, sales, and profitability. They can write suggested orders for our buyers to approve. They can communicate with our creative team and make changes to their brand boutiques on the site. In effect, they’re given the keys to the shop.

Why do we do this? The average buyer at Zappos has a portfolio of fifty brands, but because of transparency, there’s an additional fifty pairs of eyes helping run the business too. Not only that, vendors are the experts at what they do. No one buyer knows a brand better than the brand’s own representative. So why not leverage their knowledge to help us run a better business? As a result, when they feel empowered to manage their own business using the tools and accessibility we provide, they’ll spend more hours helping us than their typical account. The success of our team can be attributed to our buyers and vendor partners, together.



Negotiations at Zappos are a bit different as well. Instead of pounding the vendors, we collaborate. If we’re looking for longer payment terms, we’ll present different sales plans based on the days-of-payment terms. We decide together what makes the most sense for the business, the amount of risk we want to sign up for, and how quickly we want the business to grow. We approach marketing from a similar standpoint as well. We collaborate on what both of our brands are trying to achieve and what it will take us to get there. We don’t believe that negotiations need to be an arm-wrestling match. If both parties are honest about our positions and objectives, we should be able to find an equitable way to get there.



We know there’s no way we could’ve achieved our success as a company without our vendors’ commitment and passion, so every year, we like to show a little gratitude. We take over a venue such as the Hard Rock Hotel pool or Rain Nightclub at the Palms and invite all of our vendors (over one thousand) to our annual Vendor Appreciation Party. Between our vendors and the Zappos team, we have over three-thousand people on hand. We time it around the World Shoe Association convention and love it when people tell us it’s the highlight of the show. We cater food, beverages, and wildly interesting entertainment (goats in tutus, dancers, little people, fire eaters… you name it, we’ve probably had it!) with the hope they realize how much they mean to our company. The first year we did it, the vendor community was so blown away by the gesture, they talked about it for months! Now it’s become such an event that vendors we don’t work with and other retailers try to sneak in so they can enjoy the fun too.



We like to show our appreciation other times of the year too. When a brand achieves certain levels of sales, we print T-shirts for them that read: MY BRAND DID A MILLION DOLLARS OF SALES ON ZAPPOS.COM. When we dine with vendors, we always try to pick up the check. This rarely happens in the retail world, but it’s our way to WOW them as much as we try to WOW our customers. Picking up the check at dinner has actually become a competition with many of our vendors. Not too long ago, a group of us went to dinner with Rob Schmertz and Steve Madden, and because they had been so shocked when we’d picked up dinner the last time, they called ahead and made arrangements to get the check and warn the restaurant that we’d try to play tricks to get it! It rarely happens, but they scooped us!



On the last Friday of every month, Zappos also throws a golf tournament where we invite our vendors to play with us. As some say, more work gets done on the golf course than in the office. Case in point, we actually got into the eyewear category due to a conversation with our Oakley rep, Paul, after a round of golf. Today, our eyewear category is one of the largest online, but it may have never happened if we hadn’t been out building relationships with our vendors.



Our relationships aren’t limited to just the retail industry either. Our long-standing relationship with UPS has led to partnerships in finding new and unique ways to WOW our customers. They’ve been a critical part of our growth from day one, and even though we were an insignificant part of their business at the beginning, they always treated us with respect. Our longtime rep Alex works tirelessly on our behalf to find new and innovative ways to improve our service. He and UPS took the time to immerse themselves in our culture and consequently, he’s not only our representative, he’s a friend.



There are far too many vendors to name them all, but we’re also very fortunate in our partnership with Wells Fargo. When others doubted, they extended us a line of credit in a critical point in our growth. They always work with us to continue to build our business and invest the time to know us personally. They’re passionate about our business and took the time to understand it.



The benefits we’ve reaped from concentrating on building relationships with our vendors are endless. They help us plan our businesses and make sure we have enough of the right product at the right time. When inventory’s scarce, they help procure inventory on hot-selling items. Sometimes they provide unique items that can only be found on Zappos. They work closely with our marketing team to plan the right campaigns, making sure we’re in the right places. We get involved in decisions regarding the direction of their lines. In fact, one of the biggest innovations of our extranet came to be because of a suggestion from our Clarks representative, Tom. Tom observed that the extranet would be much easier if photographs of the styles were available, and it was a lightbulb moment. Today, this feature of the extranet is most helpful for not only our vendors but our buying team as well!



Because of our relationships, vendors we’re not currently working with are eager to partner with us. We have many brands on our site that customers can’t find anywhere else online, and it’s because of the trust we’ve built in the industry over the past ten years. Brands know and recognize we have the highest standards of maintaining their brand integrity and because of it, many only felt comfortable doing business with us.



Most importantly, I think of our vendors as friends. We enjoy each other’s company, spend time together outside the work environment, and genuinely care about one another. We respect and value our relationships, and want to see each other do well. I’ve known many of the people I work with for almost my entire career.



When I left Nordstrom to help start Zappos and solicit brands, it was a risky proposition. At the time, we were in a channel no one thought would work, with a company no one had ever heard of. But they supported it and were willing to put their necks on the line because of the relationship we’d built over the years. Without those friendships and their belief in us, there might not be a Zappos today. Those relationships were, and continue to be, one of the most valuable parts of our business.

Layoffs


2008 was a crazy year. We experienced some of our highest highs as well as some of our lowest lows, both inside and outside of Zappos.

We began the year celebrating our prior year’s financial performance. We had exceeded our 2007 operating profit goals, so we decided to surprise all of our employees with a onetime cash bonus equal to 10 percent of their annual salary. It was our way of thanking everyone for helping us exceed our goals.

Later that year, UPS invited Alfred and me to Beijing to watch the Olympics, which turned out to be an amazing experience.

Then the stock market and housing market collapsed. As the global economy tanked toward the end of 2008, our growth rate slowed. Even though we were still growing, we realized that our expenses were too high for the revenues we were bringing in. We had planned on faster growth and instead found that we had overhired. I was amazed that things had changed very quickly.

Just eight months after giving everyone their surprise bonus, we made the tough decision to lay off 8 percent of our staff. It was one of the hardest decisions we ever had to make for the company.

Rather than trying to spin the story as a “strategic restructuring” as many other corporations were doing, we stuck by our core values and remained open and honest, not only with our employees, but with the press as well.

I sent the following e-mail to all of our employees, which we also publicly posted on our blogs:


Date: November 6, 2008

From: Tony Hsieh

To: All Zappos Employees

Subject: Update

To all Zappos employees:

Today has been a tough, emotional day for everyone at Zappos. We made the hard choice of laying off about 8% of our employees. The layoffs will affect almost every single department at Zappos. In addition, we are also looking at closing some of our brick and mortar outlet stores in Nevada and Kentucky.


This is one of the hardest decisions we’ve had to make over the past 9.5 years, but we believe that it is the right decision for the long term health of the company. The rest of this email will explain why…


We feel fortunate that we have Sequoia Capital as an investor who had the foresight to see the ramifications of the tough economic times that lie ahead for all of us. On October 7, Sequoia held a meeting for all of their portfolio companies (including Zappos), with one very clear message: Cut expenses as much as possible and get to profitability and cash flow positive as soon as possible.



Jason Calacanis also has a well-written email that talks about avoiding the “death spiral,” which I highly recommend reading.


Fortunately for Zappos, we’re in a much better position than many other companies. Unlike many other companies, we are still growing and already profitable and cash flow positive.



And we are also fortunate that we have a revolving line of credit from Wells Fargo, US Bank, and KeyBank. This line of credit has given us a lot of financial flexibility. However, given the current economic uncertainty, we believe it’s prudent to reduce our reliance on debt financing.


We’ve decided the right thing to do for the company is to be proactive instead of reactive. We are proactively cutting back some of our expenses today so that we can take care of our employees properly, instead of being reactive and waiting until we are forced to cut expenses.



Because we are still growing and are already profitable, we do not have to take as drastic of a step as most other companies of our size. Last year, we did $840 mm in gross merchandise sales, and this year we are forecasting to do about $1 billion in gross merchandise sales. However, when we first put together our 2008 plan at the end of 2007, we were expecting our gross merchandise sales to be even higher than $1 billion.



Because of all this, we are reducing our staff by 8%, but because we are being proactive instead of reactive about it, we are able to take care of our employees and offer them more than the standard 2 weeks severance (or no severance) that most other companies are giving.



We are offering to pay each laid-off employee through the end of the year (about 2 months), and offering an additional amount for employees that have been with us for 3 or more years.


In addition, because our regular health benefits cover 100% medical, dental, and vision for employees and 50% for spouses and dependents, we decided to offer to reimburse laid-off employees for up to 6 months of COBRA payments.



In doing all of this to take care of laid-off employees, we expect that it will actually increase, not decrease, our costs for 2008, but we feel this is the right thing to do for our employees. It will put us in the position of having a lot more financial flexibility in being able to respond to potential changes in the economy in 2009.



E-commerce growth has slowed compared to its growth rate a year ago, but the good news is that even in this tough economic environment, e-commerce overall is still growing.



Within the footwear category, we are the online market leader. When times are tough, the strongest players in any market have an opportunity to gain even more market share, even if overall growth may be slower. Historically, we have actually grown faster than the overall e-commerce market, and we anticipate for that to continue in 2009.



For the rest of 2008 as well as for 2009, we anticipate continuing to grow year over year. Our current forecasts are that we will continue to be profitable and cash flow positive, as long as we are proactive instead of reactive in managing our business and financials.



I know that many tears were shed today, both by laid-off and non-laid-off employees alike. Given our family culture, our layoffs are much tougher emotionally than they would be at many other companies.



I’ve been asked by some employees whether it’s okay to Twitter about what’s going on. Our Twitter policy remains the same as it’s always been: just be real, and use your best judgment.



These are tough times for everyone, and I’m sure there will be many follow-up questions to this email. If you have any questions about your specific job or department, please talk to your department manager. For all other questions, comments, or thoughts, please feel free to email me.


—Tony Hsieh, CEO


After the weekend had passed, I sent a follow up e-mail to our remaining employees, which we also publicly posted on our blogs:


Date: November 11, 2008

From: Tony Hsieh

To: All Zappos Employees

Subject: Moving forward

Last week was a tough week for everyone, as we went through the process of laying off 8% of the Zappos family. At the same time, it was also heartwarming hearing all the stories of Zappos employees and ex-employees getting together for drinks Thursday night after the layoffs as well as over the weekend.



The economic environment we’re in right now is unlike any we’ve ever witnessed in our lifetime. These are extraordinary times, and America is not out of the woods yet. Many people expect 2–3 million Americans to lose their jobs before we hit the bottom of our current economic cycle.



As difficult as times may be, if there’s one thing I’ve learned in life, it’s that things are never as bad as they seem or as good as they seem. In most cases, this perspective usually comes long after a “bad” or “good” event has occurred.



This is actually the second time we’ve had to do layoffs across the board at Zappos. We’ve been around for 9.5 years, and the first time we had to do layoffs was during the early years of the company, when we laid off about half our staff due to a bad economy and our inability to raise funding. At the time, we still were not profitable.



However, the layoffs we did in the early days forced the team that remained to become much stronger, and because we did not have a lot of money at the time, it forced us to focus on servicing our existing customers instead of trying to acquire a lot of new customers. Ultimately, it was the catalyst for transforming Zappos from being just about shoes to a company focused on customer service and company culture. It started a domino effect that ultimately made us who we are today.


Moving forward, we have a similar opportunity. We have the opportunity to make our culture stronger than ever before. It’s something that will require everyone’s involvement and effort, but based on our history, I know it can be done.


We also have the opportunity to make the company healthier than ever before. As we come up with innovative and creative ways of generating more revenue, profits, and cash flow, we will be prioritizing them based on what will be most beneficial to our company.


One question that has come up is whether we will be doing another round of layoffs after the new year. There are currently no plans to do so. When we laid off 8% of our employees last week, we chose that number because we felt that it would cut our expenses enough to get us through all of 2009, based on our current financial forecasts. As mentioned in my previous email, our layoffs were done proactively to ensure that we would be profitable and cash flow positive in 2009.


As part of reducing our 2009 expenses, and to bring us all closer together, we are in the process of moving people so that everyone in our Las Vegas offices will be either in the 2280 or 2290 building, which are next door to each other. The moving should be completed over the next couple of weeks.


We’ve got a busy holiday season ahead, and while everyone will be busy and working hard with their individual jobs, let’s also make a conscious effort to think about how we can help each other out even more than usual—not just within your department, but crossdepartmentally and throughout the entire company as well.

Remember, this is not my company, and this is not our investors’ company. This company is all of ours, and it’s up to all of us where we go from here. The power lies in each and every one of us to move forward and come out as a team stronger than we’ve ever been in the history of the company.


Let’s show the world what Zappos is capable of.


—Tony Hsieh, CEO



We received a lot of media attention because we had been so public and transparent with our layoffs instead of trying to keep everything quiet. Going through such a dark period of time in the public eye really put our culture to the test. But as with all challenges, our employees figured out how to get through things and move on.

Looking back now, I’m incredibly thankful and grateful that we all banded together and made sure that we didn’t lose our team and family spirit. It really makes me feel proud of our employees.

I also hope that we never have to go through anything like that ever again.


Pipeline


Many corporations like to say that their people are their most important asset. There are a few problems with that approach. First, as soon as someone leaves, you’ve lost an asset. Second, if the company grows, then there may come a time later down the line when the company outgrows an employee because the employee still has the same skill set that he had when he first joined. When that happens, usually the solution in a lot of other companies is to bring in a more experienced employee from outside the company, which presents a third challenge: That new employee often may not be a culture fit.

Our philosophy at Zappos is different. Rather than focusing on individuals as assets, we instead focus on building as our asset a pipeline of people in every single department with varying levels of skills and experience, ranging from entry level all the way up through senior management and leadership positions. Our vision is for almost all of our hires to be entry level, but for the company to provide all the training and mentorship necessary so that any employee has the opportunity to become a senior leader within the company within five to seven years. For us, this is still a work in progress, but we’re really excited about its future.

Without continually growing and learning both personally and professionally, it’s unlikely that any individual employee will still be with the company ten years from now. Our goal at Zappos is for our employees to think of their work not as a job or career, but as a calling.

Our pipeline strategy started when we first moved to Vegas in 2004. Even though Vegas was great for hiring for our call center, we found it challenging to convince merchandisers and buyers who had years of industry experience to move from places such as Los Angeles or New York to Las Vegas. So we decided to start training and growing our own merchants from the ground up.

Today, nearly all of the hires for our merchandising department are for entry-level merchandising assistants. We have a three-year merchant development program where merchandising assistants are trained, certified, and given increasing portfolio responsibilities as well as put into management and leadership roles.

At the entry level, all we really care about is if they are passionate about the category of product their team is responsible for. For our couture team, we hire people who love reading fashion magazines. For our running team, we hire marathoners. For our outdoors team, we hire people who regularly go hiking and camping on weekends.

Over a three-year period, merchandising assistants are promoted to assistant buyers and then to buyers. (After three years, they can go on to become senior buyers, directors, and eventually VPs.)

Our pipeline philosophy has been incredibly successful within our merchandising department, and we’ve spent the past year working on rolling out similar programs for all of our departments.

There are specific training programs that are unique to each department, but we also have a Pipeline Team that offers courses for all departments. Many of the courses are required in order for an employee to be promoted to certain levels within the company, regardless of which department he or she may be in.

Once our pipeline is filled for every department, then anytime a single individual leaves the company, there will always be someone right in front of him and someone right behind him in the pipeline to take over his responsibilities. In this way, the pipeline becomes the true asset of the company, not any single individual.

Over the longer term, we are also planning on extending the pipeline concept up to four years before an entry-level employee joins Zappos. If our recruiting team can start building relationships with college students when they first start as freshmen, and offer summer internship positions at Zappos during their time in school, then by the time they graduate from college, both sides will have a pretty good idea of whether Zappos is the right fit for the student.

Once our entire eleven-year pipeline is built (from four years prior to joining Zappos all the way through seven years after joining Zappos), we’ll have a substantial long-term competitive advantage over everyone else. Combined with our ongoing efforts to grow our brand and our culture, we believe that our BCP (Brand, Culture, Pipeline) strategy will provide the platform necessary for Zappos to be a long-term enduring and growing business.

SECTION III


PROFITS, PASSION, AND PURPOSE


Taking It to the Next Level


PR and Public Speaking


In the two years leading up to the announcement of the Amazon acquisition, Zappos started getting more and more media coverage. A lot of people assumed that we must have stepped up our PR efforts, but that wasn’t the case at all. We simply continued doing what we had always done: constantly improving the customer experience while simultaneously strengthening our culture.

The funny thing is that a lot of the press we got was for things we had first done several years earlier, such as paying employees to quit during their new hire training or occasionally sending flowers to customers. We didn’t intend for any of the things we were doing to end up in the news or on blogs. But every once in a while, a reporter or popular blogger would pick up on something that we were doing, and the story would spread like wildfire. We were as surprised as anyone else by the publicity because it was never planned for on our end.

We learned a great lesson: If you just focus on making sure that your product or service continually WOWs people, eventually the press will find out about it. You don’t need to put a lot of effort into reaching out to the press if your company naturally creates interesting stories as a by-product of delivering a great product or experience.

As our media coverage increased, I started receiving more and more speaking requests for different conferences and industry events. One of my first speeches was at the Footwear News CEO Summit in 2005. I remember I was a nervous wreck, because I hadn’t really done much public speaking before. At the time, I agreed to do it because it would be a good opportunity to tell the Zappos story to a lot of footwear vendors we were still trying to establish relationships with.

I wrote out my entire speech beforehand, and then spent a month memorizing it and rehearsing it. I couldn’t sleep the night before my speech. It ended up going okay, and I was relieved when it was finally over so I could catch up on my sleep. Even though I didn’t really enjoy the whole experience, it had a very positive impact on our business, so I was glad I had done it.

Over the next year, a few more speaking requests started trickling in. I agreed to all of them with a feeling of dread, but I knew they would help build our business and our brand. I also thought that, as uncomfortable as I was with doing them, they were opportunities for me to grow both personally and professionally. Like anything else in life, I figured that public speaking was just a skill that required practice on a regular basis. Each speech I gave was just another practice session.

During my first year of public speaking, I was diligent about writing out my speeches beforehand and memorizing them. It took a lot of time to do, and I would never sleep well the night before my talks. Sometimes, while giving the speech, I would accidentally skip over or forget a sentence or an entire paragraph, which would leave me temporarily flustered on stage as I racked my brain trying to remember the lines I had practiced the night before.

With each speech, I found myself slowly improving. But I still didn’t enjoy the actual speaking itself. Even though my speaking was helping build the Zappos brand, I thought that maybe I just wasn’t meant to be a public speaker because I was so uncomfortable with the process, even after having done it for a year.

And then one day, I had an epiphany.

I realized that nobody knew what I had written down beforehand. Nobody would ever know if I skipped a sentence, a paragraph, or even an entire section.

I had also noticed that while people appreciated the content of my speeches, they generally commented about two things afterward. They told me they really enjoyed the personal stories, and they said that, even though many of them had already read about Zappos in the press, it made a huge difference to actually hear it come from me. They told me they could really feel my passion for company culture, customer service, and Zappos in general.

So, for my next speech, I tried a completely different approach.

I decided not to memorize or rehearse anything. I would just wing it and see what happened. I knew I had a lot of stories I could choose from on the fly to tell, and I knew that as long as I stuck to topics I was passionate and knowledgeable about—customer service and company culture—that I would have plenty of material to draw from to fill the time.

When I finally got on stage, I still had some jitters for the first minute or two as I adjusted to the audience and the room. After that, the time just flew by. The audience was more engaged than they had been in my previous talks. I even managed to get some unexpected laughs from moments in my stories when I was just trying to tell a story instead of trying to recite lines from a script I’d written.

I would later learn that I had achieved the state of flow. In his book by the same name, researcher Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi describes flow as a type of happiness, in which someone loses sense of time, self-consciousness, and even self. That’s exactly what happened to me.

From that point forward, I used the same formula for all of my speeches and found that most of the rest of the stuff that I used to worry about usually just fell into place. I just went by three basic rules for my talks:

1) Be passionate.

2) Tell personal stories.

3) Be real.

I made the mistake once of agreeing to speak at a conference about a topic that I wasn’t actually passionate about. Even though I knew all the content inside and out, I wasn’t able to speak passionately, so my performance turned out to be only okay. But it was a good learning experience.

Today, whenever I’m invited to speak somewhere, I let them know that I will only speak about certain subjects, which may or may not match the overall theme of the conference. I then leave it up to the conference organizers to decide whether they are okay with that or not. Usually they are fine with it, but occasionally not.

In those instances, no matter how much money the conference is offering to pay Zappos and no matter how good an opportunity it would be for Zappos to be exposed to that audience, I always do the same thing.

I politely decline.


Insights


As we started getting more and more speaking requests at Zappos, we started sending other people from different departments to speak as well. Just like in our culture book, different employees told their own personal stories and gave their own presentations and perspective. To this day, we don’t have a standard PowerPoint presentation that everyone gives.

All the speaking we’ve done has led to a lot of unexpected results that we could not have possibly predicted. In addition to plenty of coverage in blogs and in the media, we’ve gotten to know many, many different conference organizers, which led to speaking engagements at Tony Robbins events, TEDIndia (Technology, Entertainment, Design), SXSW (South by Southwest), a conference where the Dalai Lama also spoke, and the Inc. 500 Conference. I’ve met many of the authors whose books we admire and carry in the Zappos Library, including Jim Collins, Seth Godin, and Chip Conley. We’ve had people from all levels of a lot of different companies tour our headquarters as a result of our public speaking appearances. From those, we’ve developed many great relationships and business opportunities that would have otherwise never happened.

We apply our core values whenever we give these talks. Rather than use our speaking opportunities to explicitly promote Zappos, we instead try to share as much as possible about how we do things in order to help the audience Pursue Growth and Learning. And in line with our core value of trying to Build Open and Honest Relationships With Communication, we’re happy to share numbers and other detailed information.

All of this led to the single biggest unexpected result of our public speaking: realizing that we were actually changing other companies and other people’s lives. It slowly started sinking in that we could be part of something that was much bigger than Zappos. We realized that we could change the world not just by doing things differently at Zappos, but by helping change how other companies did things.

It’s been rewarding to hear from other people and companies about how they’ve changed their lives or the way they run their companies by doing things such as implementing core values, focusing more on customer service, and focusing more on company culture and employee happiness, and how doing so has actually improved their financial performance as well.

We continue to hear from people every day that Zappos inspired them to run their business differently, not necessarily because they wanted to be just like Zappos, but because they saw a real-life example that it was actually possible to run a values-based company that also focuses on everyone’s happiness. They saw that it wasn’t just theory, that there was a way to combine profits, passion, and purpose.

The feedback and stories we received led us to develop Zappos Insights, an online video subscription service, and Zappos Insights Live, a two-day immersion seminar. Both programs are designed to help entrepreneurs and established businesses improve their companies. Many participants are specifically interested in learning how to create stronger cultures and their own set of core values.

As we rolled out these additional services, we slowly realized that we were becoming part of a bigger movement. It was no longer just about Zappos. We were helping change the world.

Alignment


We did not invent the idea that having a vision that had a higher purpose was important. We did not invent the idea that having a strong culture and core values was important. Both of those ideas were highlighted in Good to Great and Tribal Leadership, and have been around long before those books were published.

But through tours, the culture book, public speaking, Zappos Insights, Zappos Insights Live, Twitter, and our blogs, we found ourselves in a unique position: We had scaled our business from nothing to over $1 billion in gross merchandise sales in less than ten years, we had a strong set of integrated core values, and our culture of being open and honest and pursuing growth and learning was leading us to share, rather than hoard all the corporate knowledge and learning we had accumulated over the years.

We had a tough time convincing our board of directors (who were also investors) to embrace many of our activities that we believed would ultimately help build the Zappos brand and make the world a better place. The directors on our board came from primarily technology and manufacturing backgrounds, not retail or branding. Some of them didn’t fully understand why we were doing Zappos Insights or why we wanted to embrace Twitter (see the Appendix for the link to my blog post on “How Twitter Can Make You a Better and Happier Person”), and they weren’t really convinced of the value of the Brand/Culture/Pipeline platform we were building. Many of our efforts were dismissed by some members of our board of directors as “Tony’s social experiments.”

For the most part, members of our board of directors wanted us to just focus on the financial performance that was being driven by our e-commerce business.

Which made perfect sense.

When Sequoia first invested in 2005, they had signed up to help build a service-focused e-commerce company. They probably expected some sort of financial exit (in the form of an acquisition or IPO) within five years, which was the time line they saw from many of their other investments. They hadn’t signed up for the additional things that we now wanted to do that were longer-term strategies and not directly related to e-commerce, and they certainly didn’t sign up for us to help other businesses create their own visions or stronger cultures.

But I saw the potential in what we were doing to make a much bigger impact beyond just Zappos. I’m pretty sure that my refusal to give up on that got me pretty close to being fired by the board. The five-year mark from the time of their initial investment was fast approaching. Alfred, Fred, and I didn’t want to sell the company, and due to a complicated capital structure involving liquidation preferences, attempting to go public during an economically turbulent time wasn’t really an option either.

In early 2009, we made Fortune magazine’s “100 Best Companies to Work For” list. We were the highest-ranking debut in 2009. At our offices, we were thrilled because that was an internal goal we had set in the early days of the company, and it came just a month after we hit our $1 billion in gross merchandise sales goal, well ahead of schedule.

But at the board level, we were at a stalemate. The board wanted a financial exit, but internally at Zappos we didn’t want to exit. We wanted to continue to build, and we were in this for the long haul. Luckily, I controlled enough voting rights so that the board couldn’t force us to sell the company, but they controlled enough board seats so that in theory they could fire me and hire a new CEO who didn’t care about company culture and was only concerned about maximizing profits from our e-commerce business.

I realized I was relearning another version of the same lesson from LinkExchange, when our company culture went downhill: the importance of alignment. A strong culture and committable core values are important because they create alignment among employees. I was now learning that alignment with shareholders and the board of directors was just as important.


Top 10 Questions to Ask When Looking for Investors and Board Members


Do you really need investors? Can you avoid funding by growing more slowly?

How actively involved will your investors be? How actively involved do you want your investors to be?

What value beyond money can your investors add (connections, advice, experience)?

What is the time horizon for a financial exit that your investors are expecting?

What, if anything, are your investors hoping to get out of their involvement beyond just financial return? How would they prioritize those things?

Do your investors and board of directors buy into the vision and mission of the company?

Would they accept less profits if it meant that the vision could be fulfilled faster?

How flexible are your investors and board members in their thinking?

Who controls the investors? Who controls the board?

Do the core values of your investors and board members match the core values of the company?



Alfred, Fred, and I brainstormed ways we could address the alignment issues we were having with our board of directors. We certainly didn’t want to sell the company and move on to something else. To us, Zappos wasn’t just a job or something to build our careers. It was a calling. We had too much of an emotional investment in the company to just give up. We had gotten through much tougher things at Zappos before. This was just another challenge we needed to figure out. So we came up with a plan.

We would buy out our board of directors.

Amazon


We figured it would cost about $200 million to buy out our board of directors, so we started looking for other potential investors. In early 2009, we started talking to various private equity firms, venture investors, wealthy family businesses, and wealthy individuals. The idea was to raise money from them for a stake in the company so that we could then buy out Sequoia and some of our other shareholders and board members.

As we were going through the process of talking with these different potential investors, Amazon contacted us. We had been in touch with them for the past several years.

Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon, first contacted me back in 2005 and paid us a visit in Las Vegas. Even before he flew down, we let him know that we weren’t looking to sell the company.


Date: August 16, 2005

From: Tony Hsieh

To: Jeff Bezos

Subject: Thursday’s Amazon/Zappos meeting

Hi Jeff—



I’m looking forward to meeting you in person on Thursday.



I just wanted to set proper expectations before the meeting and reiterate that we are looking to grow Zappos as an independent company at this point in time, but are always open to exploring partnership opportunities. I look forward to hearing your ideas on Thursday…

When we started talking to Amazon in early 2009, however, both sides seemed to have a different perspective compared with several years ago. On the Amazon side, they seemed to be more open to the idea of us continuing to run as an independent entity so that we could continue building the Zappos culture and business the way we wanted to. They had been following our progress over the years and saw that our approach to business was working for us. On the Zappos side, what mattered the most was continuing to do what we were doing for our employees and our customers while gaining access to Amazon’s vast resources.

In our minds, we thought of a potential acquisition scenario more as a great marriage than as selling the company. Both companies cared deeply about being customer-centric. We each just had different approaches to it. We thought of Zappos as being more high-touch, and Amazon as being more high-tech.

Even though our original goal was to buy out just our board of directors and the shares that they held and represented, the more we thought about it, the more that joining forces seemed to make sense. By doing so, all parties would be 100 percent aligned, which was the whole challenge that we were trying to overcome with our current board of directors.

We had originally been resistant to the idea of exploring an acquisition scenario with Amazon, but Michael Moritz convinced us that it could end up being mutually beneficial and the best possible outcome for shareholders as well as employees. (And, as it would turn out, he was right.)


Initially, Amazon wanted to literally buy Zappos using cash because that’s how they had done most of their previous acquisitions. That didn’t sit well with Alfred, Fred, or myself. In our minds, that felt too much like we were selling the company. Selling our company wasn’t our goal. We wanted to continue building the Zappos brand, business, and culture. And we wanted to continue to feel like owners of the company.

So we pushed hard for an all-stock transaction, meaning that Zappos shareholders would simply trade in their stock in exchange for Amazon shares. In our minds, this was much more in the spirit of the marriage that we were envisioning, analogous to when married couples get a joint bank account.

As both sides got to know each better over the next several months, our levels of mutual trust and respect for each other and for each other’s businesses grew. When it finally came time to sign the paperwork, we felt incredibly lucky. Amazon was a win–win-win situation that made everyone happy: It was good for Amazon, good for our board of directors and shareholders, and good for Zappos employees. We could continue working toward our long-term vision and building our culture and our business the way we wanted to. If it weren’t for Amazon, I’m not sure how we would have ended up resolving our alignment issues with the board. We might have remained at a stalemate. But as it turned out, our misalignment with the board turned out to be a blessing in disguise. It just goes to show that you never know when something you perceive as a negative will ultimately turn out to be a good thing.

The hardest part about the whole process was having to keep everything secret from our employees for the several months leading up to the signing of the paperwork. We didn’t want to do it, but were legally required to by the SEC because Amazon was a public company.

Jeff Bezos flew to Vegas and came to my house to meet Alfred, Fred, and myself right before the actual signing of the legal paperwork. I barbecued burgers for him in my backyard and we all talked for a few hours. Later that night, Fred and I randomly ended up spending two hours in a recording studio talking and hanging out with Snoop Dogg. At the end of the night, Fred and I looked at each other and couldn’t help but laugh. The entire day had been beyond surreal.

July 22, 2009, was the day we were planning on signing and announcing the pending acquisition to our employees and to the world. We planned on announcing after the stock market closed. The hours leading up to the public announcement were nerve racking. We had to coordinate with Amazon to get all the timing down perfectly. We had to communicate with Zappos employees, Zappos vendors, Amazon employees, Amazon vendors, the press calling Amazon, the press calling Zappos, our customers, the SEC, our board of directors, our investors, and the general public all within a two-hour window, and it had to be perfectly coordinated. It felt like we were about to launch a rocket to the moon.

Finally, at the predetermined time, I sent the following e-mail to our employees:


Date: July 22, 2009

From: Tony Hsieh


To: All Zappos Employees



Subject: Zappos and Amazon



Please set aside 20 minutes to carefully read this entire email. (My apologies for the occasional use of formal-sounding language, as parts of it are written in a particular way for legal reasons.)



Today is a big day in Zappos history.



This morning, our board approved and we signed what’s known as a “definitive agreement,” in which all of the existing shareholders and investors of Zappos (there are over 100) will be exchanging their Zappos stock for Amazon stock. Once the exchange is done, Amazon will become the only shareholder of Zappos stock.

Over the next few days, you will probably read headlines that say “Amazon acquires Zappos” or “Zappos sells to Amazon.” While those headlines are technically correct, they don’t really properly convey the spirit of the transaction. (I personally would prefer the headline “Zappos and Amazon sitting in a tree…”)



We plan to continue to run Zappos the way we have always run Zappos—continuing to do what we believe is best for our brand, our culture, and our business. From a practical point of view, it will be as if we are switching out our current shareholders and board of directors for a new one, even though the technical legal structure may be different.



We think that now is the right time to join forces with Amazon because there is a huge opportunity to leverage each other’s strengths and move even faster toward our long term vision. For Zappos, our vision remains the same: delivering happiness to customers, employees, and vendors. We just want to get there faster.



We are excited about doing this for 3 main reasons:



We think that there is a huge opportunity for us to really accelerate the growth of the Zappos brand and culture, and we believe that Amazon is the best partner to help us get there faster.

Amazon supports us in continuing to grow our vision as an independent entity, under the Zappos brand and with our unique culture.

We want to align ourselves with a shareholder and partner that thinks really long term (like we do at Zappos), as well as do what’s in the best interest of our existing shareholders and investors.


I will go through each of the above points in more detail below, but first, let me get to the top 3 burning questions that I’m guessing many of you will have.


Top 3 Burning Questions

Q: Will I still have a job?

As mentioned above, we plan to continue to run Zappos as an independent entity. In legal terminology, Zappos will be a “wholly-owned subsidiary” of Amazon. Your job is just as secure as it was a month ago.


Q: Will the Zappos culture change?


Our culture at Zappos is unique and always evolving and changing, because one of our core values is to Embrace and Drive Change. What happens to our culture is up to us, which has always been true. Just like before, we are in control of our destiny and how our culture evolves.


A big part of the reason why Amazon is interested in us is because they recognize the value of our culture, our people, and our brand. Their desire is for us to continue to grow and develop our culture (and perhaps even a little bit of our culture may rub off on them).


They are not looking to have their folks come in and run Zappos unless we ask them to. That being said, they have a lot of experience and expertise in a lot of areas, so we’re very excited about the opportunities to tap into their knowledge, expertise, and resources, especially on the technology side. This is about making the Zappos brand, culture, and business even stronger than it is today.

Q: Are Tony, Alfred, or Fred leaving?



No, we have no plans to leave. We believe that we are at the very beginning of what’s possible for Zappos and are very excited about the future and what we can accomplish for Zappos with Amazon as our new partner. Part of the reason for doing this is so that we can get a lot more done more quickly.



There is an additional Q&A section at the end of this email, but I wanted to make sure we got the top 3 burning questions out of the way first. Now that we’ve covered those questions, I wanted to share in more detail our thinking behind the scenes that led us to this decision.


First, I want to apologize for the suddenness of this announcement. As you know, one of our core values is to Build Open and Honest Relationships With Communication, and if I could have it my way, I would have shared much earlier that we were in discussions with Amazon so that all employees could be involved in the decision process that we went through along the way. Unfortunately, because Amazon is a public company, there are securities laws that prevented us from talking about this to most of our employees until today.


We’ve been on friendly terms with Amazon for many years, as they have always been interested in Zappos and have always had a great respect for our brand.

Several months ago, they reached out to us and said they wanted to join forces with us so that we could accelerate the growth of our business, our brand, and our culture. When they said they wanted us to continue to build the Zappos brand (as opposed to folding us into Amazon), we decided it was worth exploring what a partnership would look like.


We learned that they truly wanted us to continue to build the Zappos brand and continue to build the Zappos culture in our own unique way. I think “unique” was their way of saying “fun and a little weird.”:)

Over the past several months, as we got to know each other better, both sides became more and more excited about the possibilities for leveraging each other’s strengths. We realized that we are both very customer-focused companies—we just focus on different ways of making our customers happy.


Amazon focuses on low prices, vast selection and convenience to make their customers happy, while Zappos does it through developing relationships, creating personal emotional connections, and delivering high-touch (“WOW”) customer service.



We realized that Amazon’s resources, technology, and operational experience had the potential to greatly accelerate our growth so that we could grow the Zappos brand and culture even faster. On the flip side, through the process Amazon realized that it really was the case that our culture is the platform that enables us to deliver the Zappos experience to our customers. Jeff Bezos (CEO of Amazon) made it clear that he had a great deal of respect for our culture and that Amazon would look to protect it.


We asked our board members what they thought of the opportunity. Michael Moritz, who represents Sequoia Capital (one of our investors and board members), wrote the following: “You now have the opportunity to accelerate Zappos’ progress and to make the name and the brand and everything associated with it an enduring, permanent part of people’s lives… You are now free to let your imagination roam—and to contemplate initiatives and undertakings that today, in our more constrained setting, we could not take on.”


One of the great things about Amazon is that they are very long term thinkers, just like we are at Zappos. Alignment in very long term thinking is hard to find in a partner or investor, and we felt very lucky and excited to learn that both Amazon and Zappos shared this same philosophy.




All this being said, this was not an easy decision. Over the past several months, we had to weigh all the pros and cons along with all the potential benefits and risks. At the end of the day, we realized that, once it was determined that this was in the best interests of our shareholders, it basically all boiled down to asking ourselves 2 questions:


1. Do we believe that this will accelerate the growth of the Zappos brand and help us fulfill our mission of delivering happiness faster?


2. Do we believe that we will continue to be in control of our own destiny so that we can continue to grow our unique culture?


After spending a lot of time with Amazon and getting to know them and understanding their intentions better, we reached the conclusion that the answers to these 2 questions are YES and YES.

The Zappos brand will continue to be separate from the Amazon brand. Although we’ll have access to many of Amazon’s resources, we need to continue to build our brand and our culture just as we always have. Our mission remains the same: delivering happiness to all of our stakeholders, including our employees, our customers, and our vendors. (As a side note, we plan to continue to maintain the relationships that we have with our vendors ourselves, and Amazon will continue to maintain the relationships that they have with their vendors.)


We will be holding an all hands meeting soon to go over all of this in more detail. Please email me any questions that you may have so that we can cover as many as possible during the all hands meeting and/or a follow-up email.


We signed what’s known as the “definitive agreement” today, but we still need to go through the process of getting government approval, so we are anticipating that this transaction actually won’t officially close for at least a few months. We are legally required by the SEC to be in what’s known as a “quiet period,” so if you get any questions related to the transaction from anyone including customers, vendors, or the media, please let them know that we are in a quiet period mandated by law and have them email tree@zappos.com, which is a special email account that Alfred and I will be monitoring.



Alfred and I would like to say thanks to the small group of folks on our finance and legal teams and from our advisors at Morgan Stanley, Fenwick & West, and PricewaterhouseCoopers who have been working really hard, around the clock, and behind the scenes over the last several months to help make all this possible.



Before getting to the Q&A section, I’d also like to thank everyone for taking the time to read this long email and for helping us get to where we are today.

It’s definitely an emotional day for me. The feelings I’m experiencing are similar to what I felt in college on graduation day: excitement about the future mixed with fond memories of the past. The last 10 years were an incredible ride, and I’m excited about what we will accomplish together over the next 10 years as we continue to grow Zappos!

Q&A

Q: Will we still continue to grow our headquarters out of Vegas?

Yes! Just like before, we plan to continue to grow our Las Vegas operations as long as we can continue to attract the right talent for each of our departments. We do not have any plans to move any departments, nor does Amazon want us to because they recognize that our culture is what makes the Zappos brand special.



Q: What will happen to our warehouse in Kentucky?



As many of you know, we were strategic in choosing our warehouse location due to its proximity to the UPS Worldport hub in Louisville. Amazon does not have any warehouse locations that are closer to the Worldport hub. There is the possibility that they may want to store some of their inventory in our warehouse or vice-versa. Right now, both Zappos and Amazon believe that the best customer experience is to continue running our warehouse in Kentucky at its current location.




Q: Will we be reducing staff in order to gain operational efficiency?



There are no plans to do so at this time. Both Zappos and Amazon are focused on growth, which means we will need to hire more people to help us grow.



Q: Will we get a discount at Amazon?



No, because we are planning on continuing to run Zappos as a separate company with our own culture and core values. And we’re not going to be giving the Zappos discount to Amazon employees either, unless they bake us cookies and deliver them in person.



Q: Will our benefits change?



No, we are not planning on making any changes (outside of the normal course of business) to our benefit packages.





Q: Do we keep our core values?



Yes, we will keep our core values, and Amazon will keep their core values.



Q: Will our training/pipeline programs or progression plans change? Will there still be more growth opportunities?



We will continue building out our pipeline and progression as planned. The whole point of this combination is to accelerate our growth, so if anything, we are actually anticipating more growth opportunities for everyone.


Q: Will we continue to do the special things we do for our customers? Are our customer service policies going to change?



Just like before, that’s completely up to us to decide.



Q: Can you tell me a bit more about Jeff Bezos (Amazon CEO)? What is he like?



We’d like to show an 8-minute video of Jeff Bezos that will give you some insight into his personality and way of thinking. He shares some of what he’s learned as an entrepreneur, as well as some of the mistakes he’s made.

Q: I’m a business/financial reporter. Can you talk like a banker and use fancy-sounding language that we can print in a business publication?



Zappos is an online footwear category leader and Amazon believes Zappos is the right team with a unique culture, proven track record, and the experience to become a leading soft goods company; Zappos’ customer service obsession reinforces Amazon’s mission to be the earth’s most customer-centric company; Great brand, strong vendor relationships, broad selection, large active and repeat customer base; Amazon believes Zappos is a great business—growing, profitable and positive cash flow; Accelerate combined companies’ scale and growth trajectory in the shoe, apparel and accessories space; Significant synergy opportunities, including technology, marketing, and possible international expansion.



Q: What is the purchase price?



This is not a cash transaction. This is a stock exchange. Our shareholders and option holders will be issued approximately 10 million Amazon shares on a fully converted basis. The details of the deal terms and how the shares will be distributed will be filed with the SEC on Form S-4 and will be publicly available when it is filed.



Q: Can you talk like a lawyer now?



This email was sent on July 22, 2009. In connection with the proposed merger, Amazon.com will file a registration statement on Form S-4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission that will contain a consent solicitation/prospectus. Zappos’ shareholders and investors are urged to carefully read the consent solicitation/prospectus when it becomes available and other relevant documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the proposed merger because they contain important information about Amazon.com, Zappos and the proposed merger. Shareholders and investors will be able to obtain the consent solicitation/prospectus when it becomes available at www.sec.gov or www.amazon.com/ir.

Q: Can you please stop?


okthxbye


About twenty minutes afterward, I sent a follow-up e-mail letting our employees know that we would be having our all-hands meeting two days later. We had rented out one of the ballrooms in a conference center near our offices.

And then, a funny thing happened. We had prepped the managers of each of the departments earlier that morning to meet with their teams to answer any questions they may have about my e-mail. We had expected and planned for there to be no productivity for the rest of the day as our employees took in the news.

As predicted, employees were initially surprised by the news.

As predicted, employees had questions.

But within an hour of the announcement, our employees got right back to work, continuing whatever they had been doing earlier. Our merchandising team was busy making phone calls to our vendors and a handful of us were busy dealing with inquiries from the press. But other than that, for most people, it was back to business as usual. I was absolutely amazed.

I had been worried that employees would be too shocked by the headline of Amazon acquiring Zappos to really take in all the details that were covered in my e-mail. Instead, after the initial surprise had subsided, I overheard employees talking in the hallways about how excited and enthusiastic they were about the new possibilities that would open up once we had access to Amazon’s resources.

It was an incredible thing to witness, and perhaps one of the best examples of our employees embracing and driving change.



All Hands


The room was packed. I was on stage at our all-hands meeting, looking over a crowd of seven hundred Zappos employees. Alfred and Fred were on stage with me, along with a couple of people from Amazon.

Party music filled the room as employees streamed in looking for empty seats. I could feel the buzz and excitement in the air. Some employees brought beach balls and started throwing them around into the crowd. It felt like we were at a rock concert and a rave, combined.

We announced that we were going to start the meeting, and everyone cheered and started clapping. The energy in the room was amazing.

We spent about an hour covering everything that was in the e-mail I had sent out two days earlier and answered additional questions our employees had. Amazon also answered some of the questions to give their perspective on everything.

“I get asked by a lot by people what we would do differently if we had to do Zappos all over again,” I said to the crowd. “There’s actually not much that I wish we would have done differently. We’ve made a lot of mistakes along the way, but learning from those mistakes has made us that much stronger. But I do wish that we could have done things faster.”

And then I summed everything up in one sentence: “Getting married to Amazon will allow us to fulfill our vision of delivering happiness to the world that much faster.”

As a surprise to our employees, Alfred and I announced that we were personally paying for and giving every employee a Kindle, Amazon’s electronic book reader. And then, as a final surprise, we also announced that Amazon was paying for a big bonus to all of our existing employees to thank everyone for their hard work.

Without any prompting, everyone in the entire room spontaneously jumped from their seats, standing up cheering and clapping. A lot of them even had tears of happiness streaming down their faces. Just like we surprise many of our loyal repeat customers with unexpected upgrades to overnight shipping, we had just made our already happy employees even happier with the surprise bonus.

To me, that one moment represented success far beyond what I could have possibly imagined would be achievable ten years ago. It wasn’t just about the Kindle or the bonus. Those were just… bonuses.

The moment signified far more than that. The unified energy and emotion of everyone in the room was not just about my own personal happiness, and not just about the happiness of Zappos employees. We were about much more than just profits and passion. Collectively, this marked the beginning of the next leg of our journey to help change the world.

Half intentionally and half by luck, we had found our path to profits, passion, and purpose.

We had found our path to delivering happiness.



Halloween Toast


On October 31, at 11:59 PM Pacific Time, after months of waiting for regulatory approval, the deal with Amazon officially closed. The total value of the transaction for Zappos shareholders was over $1.2 billion, based on Amazon’s closing stock price the day before.

I happened to be in New Delhi, India, at the time. Alfred, Fred, and I had scheduled a conference call together to commemorate the event. In Zappos tradition, we had planned to take a shot of Grey Goose vodka together over the phone.

“What should we toast to?” Alfred asked.

For some reason, the first thing that came to my mind was Buzz Lightyear from the movie Toy Story.

“To infinity and beyond!” I said.

We all toasted. It was official. Zappos and Amazon were married. We could finally start working together to combine our respective strengths of art and science, of high-touch and high-tech.

We were excited about the possibilities of what was yet to come.

End Game



Delivering Happiness


So far, this book has been about me, about Zappos, and about some of the lessons we’ve learned along the way.

So far, you’ve been a passive reader.

As we near the final pages of this book, I’d like to ask you to actively participate and think about the answer to this question:

“What is your goal in life?”

When I ask different people this question, I get a lot of different answers. Some people say they want to start a company. Other people say they want to find a boyfriend or girlfriend. Others say they want to get healthy.

Whatever your response is, I’d like you to think about your answer to the follow-up question:

“Why?”

Depending on what they said before, people might say they want to retire early, or find a soulmate, or run faster.

Again, whatever your response to the previous question was, I’d like you to ask yourself:

“Why?”

The next set of answers people give might be so they can spend more time with their family, or get married, or run a marathon.

What’s interesting is that if you keep asking yourself “Why?” enough times, you’ll find yourself arriving at the same answer that most people do when they repeatedly ask themselves why they are doing what they are doing: They believe that whatever they are pursuing in life will ultimately make them happier.

In the end, it turns out that we’re all taking different paths in pursuit of the same goal: happiness.



In 2007, I started getting interested in learning more about the science of happiness. I learned that it was a relatively new research field known as positive psychology. Prior to 1998, almost all psychology was about trying to figure out how to get people who had something wrong with them more normal. But most psychologists and researchers never bothered to examine what would make normal people happier.

I started reading more and more books and articles about the science of happiness including Happiness Hypothesis and Happier. Initially, it was just a side hobby and interest of mine that had nothing to do with Zappos.

And then one day, it hit me. It had everything to do with Zappos. (In retrospect, it seems so obvious, but it took me over a year to figure this out.)

We’ve always had customers tell us that they think of the experience of opening up a Zappos shipment as “Happiness in a Box.” Whether it’s the happiness that customers feel when they receive the perfect pair of shoes or the perfect outfit, or the happiness that customers feel from our surprise upgrades to overnight shipping or when they talk to someone on our Customer Loyalty Team, or the happiness that employees feel from being part of a culture whose values match their own personal values—the thing that ties all of these things together is happiness.

In 2009, we expanded our vision and purpose to a simple statement:

Zappos is about delivering happiness to the world.

It’s been interesting to look at the evolution of the Zappos brand promise over the years:


1999—Largest Selection of Shoes

2003—Customer Service

2005—Culture and Core Values as Our Platform

2007—Personal Emotional Connection

2009—Delivering Happiness


From my perspective, it seemed to make sense to try to learn more about the science of happiness so that the knowledge could be applied to running our business. We could learn about some of the science behind how to make customers and employees happier. Today, we even offer a Science of Happiness class to our employees.

As I studied the field more, I learned that one of the consistent findings from the research was that people are very bad at predicting what will actually bring them sustained happiness. Most people go through their lives thinking, When I get ___, I will be happy, or When I achieve ___, I will be happy.

In fact, the research shows that the happiness they thought they would achieve fades fairly quickly. For example, there have been of studies on lottery winners that compare their happiness levels right before winning the lottery with their happiness levels a year later. The studies generally find that a person’s happiness level reverts back to wherever it was before.

To me, learning about this phenomenon was incredibly interesting. It meant that for most people, finally achieving their goal in life, whatever it was—whether it was making money, getting married, or running faster—would not actually bring them sustained happiness. And yet, many people have spent their entire lives pursuing what they thought would make them happy.

The question for you to ask yourself is whether what you think you want to pursue will actually get you the happiness you think it will get you.

If the ultimate goal is happiness, then wouldn’t it make sense for you to study and learn more about the science of happiness so that you can apply the research that’s already been done to your own life?

With just a little bit of knowledge based on the findings from scientific research, how much happier could you be?

How much happier could your customers and employees be if you applied the knowledge to your company? How much healthier would your business be as a result?

I ran my first marathon in 2006. Prior to that, I had never run more than a mile in my life. Like summiting Kilimanjaro, it was something that I just wanted to check off my list of things to do. I didn’t know anything about how to train for a marathon, so I started reading articles and books about it.

As it turned out, there had been plenty of research done about the science of running and training for a marathon. I had initially assumed that I would have to run really hard for several months every day in order to achieve the best results in the marathon, but that turned out not to be the case.

In fact, the research has shown that the best way to train for a marathon is to do long runs at a slower pace than you would actually run the marathon at. A rule of thumb is to run slow enough so that you can comfortably carry on a long conversation without being out of breath. When I tried to do that the first time, it felt almost uncomfortably slow. This training strategy is now accepted as common knowledge among marathon runners, but for the rest of us it can seem pretty counterintuitive.

Just like we instinctually know how to run, we instinctually think we know what will make us happy. But research has shown that you can perform better in a marathon if you train yourself in ways that may initially seem to go against your gut instinct. Similarly, research in the science of happiness has shown that there are things that can make you happier that you may not realize will actually make you happier. And the reverse is true as well: There are things that you think will make you happy but actually won’t in the long run.

I don’t claim to be an expert in the field of the science of happiness. I’ve just been reading books and articles about it because I find the topic really interesting. So I wanted to briefly share some of the frameworks of happiness that I personally found the most useful in helping shape my thinking, with the goal of whetting your appetite to do a little bit of reading yourself so that you can maximize your own personal level of happiness.



Happiness Framework 1


Happiness is really just about four things: perceived control, perceived progress, connectedness (number and depth of your relationships), and vision/meaning (being part of something bigger than yourself).



What’s interesting about this framework is that you can apply these concepts to your business as well.


Perceived Control

In our call center, we used to give raises once a year to our reps, which they didn’t really have any control over. We later decided to implement a “skill sets” system instead. We have about twenty different skill sets (analogous to merit badges in the Boy Scouts), with a small bump in pay associated with each of the skill sets. It’s up to each individual rep to decide whether to get trained and certified on each of the skill sets. If someone chooses not to get any, then he or she simply stays at the same pay level. If someone is ambitious and wants to gain all twenty skill sets, then we let the rep decide on the right pace to achieve that. We’ve since found that our call center reps are much happier being in control of their pay and which skill sets to attain.


Perceived Progress

In our merchandising department at Zappos, we used to promote employees from the entry-level position of merchandising assistant to the next level of assistant buyer after eighteen months of employment (assuming that they met all the requirements to qualify for the promotion). We later decided to give smaller incremental promotions every six months instead that together were the equivalent of the previous single promotion. After eighteen months (three six-month periods of smaller promotions), the end result was still the same—in terms of training, certification, and pay—as the previous promotion schedule. We’ve found that employees are much happier because there is an ongoing sense of perceived progress.


Connectedness

Studies have shown that engaged employees are more productive, and that the number of good friends an employee has at work is correlated with how engaged that employee is. In The Happiness Hypothesis, author Jonathan Haidt concludes that happiness doesn’t come primarily from within but, rather, from between. This is one of the reasons why we place so much emphasis on company culture at Zappos.


Vision/Meaning

Both Good to Great and Tribal Leadership discuss how a company with a vision that has a higher purpose beyond just money, profits, or being number one in a market is an important element of what separates a great company (in terms of long-term financial performance) from a good one.



Happiness Framework 2


Chip Conley’s book Peak does an excellent job of describing how Maslow’s Hierarchy can be condensed to three levels for business purposes and applied to customers, employees, and investors. The fundamental premise behind Maslow’s Hierarchy of human needs is that once a person’s survival needs are met (food, safety, shelter, water, etc.), then humans are more motivated by other non-materialistic needs such as social status, achievement, and creativity.


Customers: Meets expectations Meets desires Meets unrecognized needs



Employees: Money Recognition Meaning


Investors: Transaction Alignment Relationship Alignment Legacy


Many companies and managers believe that giving employees more money will make them happier, whereas most HR surveys show that once people’s basic needs are met, money is farther down the list of importance than intangibles such as the quality of the relationship with one’s manager and professional growth opportunities.

At Zappos, an example of the customer hierarchy at work would be:

Receives correct item (meets expectations).


Free shipping (meets desires).


Surprise upgrade to overnight shipping (meets unrecognized needs).



Happiness Framework 3: Three Types of Happiness: Pleasure, Passion, and Higher Purpose*


Pleasure

The pleasure type of happiness is about always chasing the next high. I like to refer to it as the “Rock Star” type of happiness because it’s great if you can have a constant inflow of stimuli, but it’s very hard to maintain unless you’re living the lifestyle of a rock star. Research has shown that of the three types of happiness, this is the shortest lasting. As soon as the source of stimuli goes away, people’s happiness levels drop immediately.


Passion

The passion type of happiness is also known as flow, where peak performance meets peak engagement, and time flies by. Research has shown that of the three types of happiness, this is the second longest lasting. Professional athletes sometimes refer to this state as “being in the zone.”


Higher Purpose

The higher-purpose type of happiness is about being part of something bigger than yourself that has meaning to you. Research has shown that of the three types of happiness, this is the longest lasting. What I find interesting is that many people go through life chasing after the pleasure type of happiness, thinking that once they are able to sustain that, then they will worry about the passion and, if they get around to it, look for their higher purpose.



Based on the findings of the research, however, the proper strategy would be to figure out and pursue the higher purpose first (since it is the longest-lasting type of happiness), then layer on top of that the passion, and then add on top of that the pleasure type of happiness.


Happiness as a Fractal


According to Merriam-Webster, a fractal is “any irregular curves or shapes for which any chosen part is similar in shape to a given larger or smaller part when magnified or reduced to the same size.”

Here is one example of a fractal (Winter Wonderland, by Dr. Ken Schwartz):



One of the properties of fractals is that if you zoom in or zoom out, the picture looks the same or very similar. According to Wikipedia, many natural objects have fractal-like properties, including clouds, mountain ranges, lightning bolts, coastlines, snowflakes, various vegetables (cauliflower and broccoli), and animal coloration patterns.

I think the parallels between what the research has found makes people happy (pleasure, passion, purpose) and what the research has found makes for great long-term companies (profits, passion, purpose) makes for one of the most interesting fractals I’ve ever come across.




At first glance, the patterns generated by geometric fractals may appear infinitely complex, but it’s often just a simple mathematical formula that generates them.

Similarly, setting out to create a great long-term company may seem to be an overwhelmingly daunting task at first, but using happiness as an organizing principle can help guide you along the way.

Even though writing a book was one of the things that I wanted to check off of my list of things to do, this book wasn’t written just for that reason.

And even though this book will serve as a handbook for future Zappos employees (and maybe get us a few additional customers as well), this book wasn’t written for the benefit of Zappos either.

I wanted to write this book for a different reason: to contribute to a happiness movement to help make the world a better place.

My hope is that through this book, established businesses will look to change the way they are doing things, and entrepreneurs will be inspired to start new companies with happiness at the core of their business models, taking with them some of the lessons I’ve learned personally as well as the lessons that we’ve collectively learned at Zappos. My hope is that more and more companies will start to apply some of the findings coming out of the research in the science of happiness field to make their business better and their customers and employees happier.

My hope is this will not only bring you happiness, but also enable you to bring other people more happiness.

If happiness is everyone’s ultimate goal, wouldn’t it be great if we could change the world and get everyone and every business thinking in that context and that framework?

I don’t have all the answers.

But hopefully I’ve succeeded in getting you to start asking yourself the right questions.

Are you working toward maximizing your happiness each day?

What is the net effect of your existence on the total amount of happiness in the world each day?

What are your values?

What are you passionate about?

What inspires you?

What is your goal in life?

What are your company’s values?

What is your company’s higher purpose?

What is your higher purpose?


When you walk with purpose, you collide with destiny.

—BERTICE BERRY

I hope reading this book has inspired you to…

… make your customers happier (through better customer service), or…

… make your employees happier (by focusing more on company culture), or…

… make yourself happier (by learning more about the science of happiness).

If this book has inspired any of the above, then I’ll have done my part in helping both Zappos and myself achieve our higher purpose: delivering happiness to the world.

Epilogue


Join the Movement


As a guiding principle in life for anything I do, I try to ask myself, What would happen if everyone in the world acted in the same way? What would the world look like? What would the net effect be on the overall happiness in the world?

This thought experiment has been useful to me when thinking about whether to share how we do things at Zappos, or whether to get upset at the waitress who accidentally got my order wrong, or whether to hold the door open for a stranger who’s a slightly inconvenient distance away.

The same questions are just as important for deciding what not to do, even if not doing anything is the default choice.

The ideas from this book could end here. You can choose to close the book and do nothing and move on with the rest of your life.

Or you can be a part of a movement to help make the world a happier and better place. The choice is yours.
